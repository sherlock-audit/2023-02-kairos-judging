# Users will not be able to take a loan in some cases

## Summary

Users will not be able to take a loan in case a tranche Id will be equal to the total number of created tranches.

## Vulnerability Detail

When user want to take a loan he should send his NFT to the contract. Of the the checks in BorrowCheckers.sol can prevent the function flow and revert the tx.

Here is a check:

if (arg.offer.tranche >= proto.nbOfTranches) {
   revert InvalidTranche(proto.nbOfTranches);
}

For example, if the totla number of created tranches is equal to 5 and offer tranche was choosen under id 5, the function will revert. 

## Impact

The protocol doesn't work correctly for some loan queries.
