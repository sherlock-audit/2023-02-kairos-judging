# Init function left open for anyone to call and initialize the protocol.

## Summary
Init function left open for anyone to call and initialize the protocol.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/Initializer.sol#L24

## Vulnerability Detail
It gives the attacker the ability to set the initial values for the contract's storage variables 
and manipulate the overall behavior of the protocol, including changing the storage variables, price factors 
in auction and the APR of the tranches, to name a few.
## Impact
The attacker can change the values of ```protocolStorage()``` and ```supplyPositionStorage()```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a modifier to only allow this function to be called by the owner for example and 
introduce an access control modifier on the init function.

```solidity
contract Initializer {
    // ...

    /// @notice initializes the kairos protocol
    function init() external onlyOwner {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
    
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only contract owner can call this function");
        _;
    }
}
```

Also this check must also be added to the init function, if you only want the init function to be called once.
```solidity
"require(!initialized, "Contract instance has already been initialized");"
```
