# `toPay` may drop to 0, some ERC20 cannot transfer 0, resulting in failure to liquidate.

## Summary

`toPay` may drop to 0, some ERC20 cannot transfer 0, resulting in failure to liquidate. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `AuctionFacet.useLoan()`, `toPay` may drop to 0 because `decreasingFactor` in `price()` may be 0:
```solidity
        Ray decreasingFactor = timeSinceLiquidable >= loan.auction.duration
            ? ZERO
            : ONE.sub(timeSinceLiquidable.div(loan.auction.duration));
```

If `toPay` is 0, some assetLent token cannot transfer 0, resulting in failure to liquidate.

## Impact

Noone can liquidate 0 price loans.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not send tokens if `toPay` is 0:
```solidity
        loan.payment.liquidated = true;
        loan.payment.paid = toPay;
        if (toPay > 0) {
            loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toPay);
        }
        loan.collateral.implem.safeTransferFrom(address(this), arg.to, loan.collateral.id);
```
