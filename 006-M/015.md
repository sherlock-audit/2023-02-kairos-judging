# Usage of transferFrom instead of safeTransferFrom for ERC20 tokens.

## Summary
At many instances the `checkedTransferFrom` function is called which uses the ERC20 `transferFrom` method. As there are many tokens that do not return a bool on ERC20 methods (e.g BNB, OMG) it is best practice to use `safeTransfer`

## Vulnerability Detail
Trying to transfer tokens which do not return a bool value will always revert

## Impact
The project will not be able to operate with ERC20 tokens which have methods that do not return a bool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's  `safeTransfer` method.
