# The lender could possibly be blocked from offering loans for some time in some cases

## Summary
The lender could possibly be completely blocked from offering loans for some time in case of a rapid changing market conditions. Additionally, borrowers can not use offers signed by lenders in some cases even though it would beneficial to both lenders and borrowers. Please check details below for a full explanation. 

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no direct way to cancel an offer signed by a lender, and the only way is to remove the ERC20's approvals given to the kairos contract (i.e. set it to zero).
In case of a rapid changing market conditions, the lender has to remove the approvals of all ERC20 token to protect him/her self from cases where there will be losses instead of profits from their loan offers. 

In other words, if the lender has offers for two NFT collections, and if one NFT collection's value goes down, the lender can not cancel the offers of this collection only. Instead, the lender has to remove the ERC20's approval. Therefore, cancelling the offers of the other collection as well even though the other collection's value wasn't impacted by the new market conditions. This is not beneficial to the lender nor to the borrower (or even the protocol), and it blocks the lender from offering loans till all the unbeneficial offers expire.

Note: although Kairos protocol expects that the offers expire in a few hours after the date of signing,  it is still possible (and likely) to have offers which expire in days or even weeks since there is no validation enforced

## Impact
- There is no direct way to cancel an offer signed by a lender which is not beneficial to the lender nor to the protocol. 
- This could possibly block the lender from offering loans for some time in case of a rapid changing market conditions.

In short, **the lender has to go all in or all out**. Have a look at the PoC below for a clearer picture.

### PoC
Given:
**Bob** is a lender 
**C** is a collection with a **token average price = 2 ether** 
**D** is a collection with a **token average price = 4 ether** 

Imagine the following scenario:
1. Bob signs offers for all tokens of **collection C** with **loanToValue = 1 ether**.
2. Bob signs offers for all tokens of **collection D** with **loanToValue = 2 ether**.
3. Let's say all offers will expire in two weeks.
4. After one week, the token average price of collection D went down to 1 ether.
5. Borrowers now can **buy the NFT with 1 ether** and **take a loan of 2 ether** from Bob. 
6. Bob realises that and **decides to cancel all offers of collection D**.
7. As there is no way to cancel the offers, Bob has to remove the ERC20's approvals given to the kairos contract.
8. Borrowers now can't take loans using collection D tokens as a collaterals. 
9. However, **owners of collection C tokens are blocked from taking loans from Bob** as well. Even though it would be profitable to both Bob and themselves.

## Code Snippet
Borrowing will revert in the absence of approvals
```sh
	// transferring the borrowed funds from the lender to the borrower
	collatState.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(signer, collatState.from, arg.amount);

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a method that can be used by lenders to cancel their offers Independently whenever needed. A simple mapping with hash(offer) => bool, can achieve that.
