# Reentrancy in  AuctionFacet.sol will manipulate order of emit

## Summary
In AuctionFacet.sol I found a Reentrancy bug. which will result in changing the order of emit .

## Vulnerability Detail
In  AuctionFacet.sol if someone buys NFT then it calls `safeTransferFrom()` to transfers NFT to buyer . As we know that  `safeTransferFrom()` will call onERC721Received() before transferring NFT to the buyer. if buyer is malicious . lets say buyer is old owner of nft who borrowed token by giving collateral as this NFT . then he can write exploited code inside onERC721Received() to call back to `claimAsBorrower()` to claim his shares. but in emit log to will shows that before selling his NFT in action  he claimed his share price .

POC :
1) Let's say bob has borrowed some tokens using his NFT.  If he is unable to repay in the required time then , his NFT will come to auction .
2) now in action bob will buy this NFT by calling `buy()` .  while sending NFT to bob it will call `safeTransferFrom()`. 
3) `safeTransferFrom()` will trigger `onERC721Received()` in bobs contract in which he will call `claimAsBorrower()` to claim his share price .  while claiming his share `claimAsBorrower()` will emit  `Claim`  event
 4)  After this it will call remaining emit `Buy` event . In logs it shows that bob has claimed his share price before selling his NFT in auction.

## Impact
According to functionality code should emit `Buy` event then a `Claim` event . but in this case malicious user is able to manipulate this emit events .  emit logs shows that before selling NFT user claimed his share price .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use reentrancy guard . Also in RepayFacet.sol `safeTransferFrom()` has used but not applied reentrancy guard to this function
