# The borrower should be able to void the unlented offer

## Summary

The borrower should be able to void the unlented offer.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function offerDigest(Offer memory offer) public view returns (bytes32) {
        return _hashTypedDataV4(typeHashOffer(offer));
    }

    /// @notice computes EIP-712 hashStruct of an nfToken
    /// @param nft - to get the hash from
    /// @return the hashStruct
    function typeHashNFToken(NFToken memory nft) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(abi.encode(NFTOKEN_TYPEHASH, nft));
    }

    /// @notice computes EIP-712 hashStruct of an offer
    /// @param offer the loan offer to hash
    /// @return the hashStruct
    function typeHashOffer(Offer memory offer) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        return
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    OFFER_TYPEHASH,
                    offer.assetToLend,
                    offer.loanToValue,
                    offer.duration,
                    offer.expirationDate,
                    offer.tranche,
                    typeHashNFToken(offer.collateral)
                )
            );
    }
```

Kairos uses the offer signed by the lender as the proof of the loan. According to the principles of cryptography, once an offer is checked out, it cannot be canceled.

There may be risks in doing so, for example, when the offer is not used, the NTF changes drastically. At this time, the lender cannot cancel his offer and the assets will be damaged.

## Impact

May result in impairment of lender funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add a mechanism for the debit side to void the offer (for example the revocation list mechanism used by the pki system).
