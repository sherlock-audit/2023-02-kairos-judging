# The protocol is not protected against Signature malleability

## Summary

OpenZeppelin has a vulnerability in versions lower than 4.7.3, which can be exploited by an attacker. 

The contract BorrowCheckers.sol (and the whole project) uses a vulnerable version (4.6.0) of the library ECDSA.sol from OpenZeppelin 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/package.json

```solidity
 "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.6.0",
```

## Vulnerability Detail

All of the conditions from the advisory are satisfied: the signature comes in a single bytes argument, ECDSA.recover() is used, and the signatures themselves are used for replay protection checks 

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h
 
If a user calls checkOfferArg(), notices a mistake, then calls checkOfferArg() again, an attacker can use signature malleability to re-submit the first change request, as long as the old request has not expired yet.

## Impact

The wrong, potentially now-malicious, address will be the valid change recipient, which could lead to the loss of funds.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowCheckers.sol#L23-L51


```solidity
  function checkOfferArg(OfferArg memory arg) internal view returns (address signer) {
        Protocol storage proto = protocolStorage();

        /* it is statistically impossible to forge a signature that would lead to finding a signer that does not aggrees
        to the signed loan offer and that usage wouldn't revert due to the absence of approved funds to mobilize. This
        is how we know the signer address can't be the wrong one without leading to a revert. */
        signer = ECDSA.recover(offerDigest(arg.offer), arg.signature);

        /* we use a lower bound, I.e the actual amount must be strictly higher that this bound as a way to prevent a 0 
        amount to be used even in the case of an uninitialized parameter for a given erc20. This bound set by governance
        is used as an anti-ddos measure to prevent borrowers to spam the creation of supply positions not worth to claim
        by lenders from a gas cost perspective after a liquidation. more info in docs */
        uint256 amountLowerBound = proto.offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[arg.offer.assetToLend];

        if (!(arg.amount > amountLowerBound)) {
            revert RequestedAmountIsUnderMinimum(arg.offer, arg.amount, amountLowerBound);
        }
        /* the offer expiration date is meant to be used by lenders as a way to manage the evolution of market
        conditions */
        if (block.timestamp > arg.offer.expirationDate) {
            revert OfferHasExpired(arg.offer, arg.offer.expirationDate);
        }

        /* as tranches can't be deactivated, checking the number of tranches allows us to deduce if the tranche id is
        valid */
        if (arg.offer.tranche >= proto.nbOfTranches) {
            revert InvalidTranche(proto.nbOfTranches);
        }
    }
```  

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change "@openzeppelin/contracts" to version 4.7.3 (patched version) or latest version 4.8.0 (recommended) in package.json
