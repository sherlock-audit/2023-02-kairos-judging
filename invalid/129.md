# BorrowFacet incosistently handles whom to return the collateral to

## Summary
Within [BorrowFacet.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowFacet.sol), `onERC721Received()` considers the borrower to be `operator`, while `borrow()` considers the token owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within [BorrowHandlers.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowHandlers.sol), `useCollateral()` saves to storage data related to the newly initiated loan. 
The inconsistency described makes it so that when a loan is repaid, the collateral is transferred to the address stored in the storage loan struct: in the case that an approved operator initiated the loan using an NFT not in his posession, Kairos will return the NFT to the operator and not its rightful owner.
Although this finding may be debatable, as the owner must have previously given approval to the operator, not returning the collateral to the original owner should be considered a code logic error.

## Impact
Incosistent loan management

## Code Snippet
From [BorrowFacet.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowFacet.sol#L21-L43):
```solidity
function onERC721Received(
    address operator,
    address, // from
    uint256 tokenId,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (bytes4) {
    OfferArg[] memory args = abi.decode(data, (OfferArg[]));

    // `operator` will be considered the borrower, enabling integration contracts to fully manage loans,
    // similarly how an approved contract can take a loan on behalf of the nft owner with the `borrow` method
    useCollateral(args, operator, NFToken({implem: IERC721(msg.sender), id: tokenId}));

    return this.onERC721Received.selector;
}

function borrow(BorrowArg[] calldata args) external {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
        args[i].nft.implem.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), args[i].nft.id);
        useCollateral(args[i].args, msg.sender, args[i].nft);
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Treat `from` to be the borrower within `onERC721Received()`
