# ECDSA Signature Malleability

## Summary

OpenZeppelin has a vulnerability in versions lower than 4.7.3, which can be exploited by an attacker. The project uses a vulnerable version

## Vulnerability Detail

the Kairos use openzeppelin package old version ^4.6.0 which is known to have bugs based on OpenZeppelin https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h . This affected versions of package are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature via ECDSA.recover and ECDSA.tryRecover due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format.

```js
File: package.json
15:   "dependencies": {
16:     "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.6.0",
```
## Impact

The functions ECDSA.recover and ECDSA.tryRecover are vulnerable to a kind of signature malleability due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format. This is only an issue for the functions that take a single bytes argument, and not the functions that take r, v, s or r, vs as separate arguments.

The potentially affected contracts are those that implement signature reuse or replay protection by marking the signature itself as used rather than the signed message or a nonce included in it. A user may take a signature that has already been submitted, submit it again in a different form, and bypass this protection.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowCheckers.sol#L29

```solidity
File: BorrowCheckers.sol
4: import {ECDSA} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol";
...
29:         signer = ECDSA.recover(offerDigest(arg.offer), arg.signature);
```

## Recommendation

Update openzeppelin ECDSA to 4.7.3.
