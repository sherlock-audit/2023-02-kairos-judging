# DDoS protection for claims after liquidation are minimal for non protected ERC20s

## Summary

DDoS, where borrowers spam the creation of supply positions not worth to claim by lenders from a gas cost perspective after a liquidation, is still vulnerable for ERC20 that is not initialized with `offerBorrowAmountLowerBound`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Kairos stated in docs that it was permissionless about which ERC20s can be lent, and it has some protection for DDoS by initializing `offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[currency]` via `setBorrowAmountPerOfferLowerBound()` called by admin. While it does protect the listed ERC20, the protection for non listed is 0 which is very minimal.


## Impact

DDOS is still possible with very minimal protection for claims after liquidation using non protected ERC20.

Also maintaining list of selected ERC20s with anti DDOS system while the other not at all could defeat the purpose of permissionless ERC20s selection.

Note :

I also submit DDoS protection issues for claim after repayment in separate submission, while seems like a duplicate, the main reason is that it is 2 different protection, maintained by 2 different state, checked in 2 different place for 2 different scenario (repayment and liquidation).


## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AdminFacet.sol#L72-L75

function used by admin to initialize anti DDOS for claim after liquidation for selected ERC20.

```solidity
    function setBorrowAmountPerOfferLowerBound(IERC20 currency, uint256 newLowerBound) external onlyOwner {
        protocolStorage().offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[currency] = newLowerBound;
        emit NewBorrowAmountPerOfferLowerBound(currency, newLowerBound);
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowCheckers.sol#L35-L39

then it will be used to protect against DDOS, but if not initialized the `amountLowerBound` will be 0.
```solidity
        uint256 amountLowerBound = proto.offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[arg.offer.assetToLend];

        if (!(arg.amount > amountLowerBound)) {
            revert RequestedAmountIsUnderMinimum(arg.offer, arg.amount, amountLowerBound);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

for uninitialized `amountLowerBound`, try to use the percentage of loaner defined `loanToValue` to set the minimum amount.

```solidity
        uint256 amountLowerBound = proto.offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[arg.offer.assetToLend];
       
       // if amountLowerBound is 0, try to set to the defined percentage of `loanToValue` (5% for instance)
       if (amountLowerBound = 0) {
            amountLowerBound = arg.offer.loanToValue * 50 / 1000; 
       }       

        if (!(arg.amount > amountLowerBound)) {
            revert RequestedAmountIsUnderMinimum(arg.offer, arg.amount, amountLowerBound);
        }
```
