# Attacker can create fake offers which when taken can revert the entire transactions preventing borrowers to borrow funds.

## Summary

In the current implementation the entire transaction would revert if just one of the offers reverts. An attacker can create fake offers that they which offer better value to borrowers and if the borrowers include these offers along with the other offers in the array, the legit offers wouldn’t be used too as the whole transaction would revert. As creating an offer doesn’t require calling kairos contracts, this would even save gas for the attacker and thus the attack can be executed more easily as the attacker can create many fake offers and the borrowers would not be able to borrow even if they use one of these offers.

This attack isn’t beneficial for the attacker but can harm the protocol as the loans wouldn’t be successful.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function useCollateral(
        OfferArg[] memory args,
        address from,
        NFToken memory nft
    ) internal returns (Loan memory loan) {
        CollateralState memory collatState = initializedCollateralState(args[0], from, nft);

        // total supply is later incremented as part of the minting of the first supply position
        uint256 firstSupplyPositionId = supplyPositionStorage().totalSupply + 1;
        uint256 nbOfOffers = args.length;
        uint256 lent; // keep track of the total amount lent/borrowed

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < nbOfOffers; i++) {
            collatState = useOffer(args[i], collatState); // @audit should this be storage or memory?
            lent += args[i].amount;
        }

        // cf RepayFacet for the rationale of this check. We prevent repaying being impossible due to an overflow in the
        // interests to repay calculation.
        if (lent > 1e40) {
            revert UnsafeAmountLent(lent);
        }
        loan = initializedLoan(collatState, from, nft, nbOfOffers, lent, firstSupplyPositionId);
        protocolStorage().loan[collatState.loanId] = loan;

        emit Borrow(collatState.loanId, abi.encode(loan));
    }
```

The contract calls useOffer for each offer. Which means if any one of the offer fails, the entire transaction would be reverted.

The attacker can revert the transaction by not approving enough tokens or creating a callback function for `safeMint` that would simply call revert every-time. The code snippet of `useOffer` where it can revert.

```solidity
collatState.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(signer, collatState.from, arg.amount);

// issuing supply position NFT to the signer of the loan offer with metadatas
safeMint(signer, Provision({amount: arg.amount, share: shareMatched, loanId: collatState.loanId}));
```

## Impact

This attack can harm the protocol as the borrowers can’t borrow and the lenders won’t be able to lend the tokens. An attacker with the sole purpose of destroying the protocol without any financial benefit of their own can easily create such attack without much loss of tokens of their own(from gas fees).

## Recommendation

Don’t revert the entire transaction if one loan fails.
