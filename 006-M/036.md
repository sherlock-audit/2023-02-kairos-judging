# Unable to transfer tokens that return no value on success

## Summary

Some popular tokens like USDT return no value on successful transfers. The `Erc20CheckedTransfer` library used does not account for this behavior resulting in unsupported ERC-20 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Kairos, when loan assets are transferred, the `Erc20CheckedTransfer` library is used to ensure that the transfer was successful. It's transfer wrapper functions are define as follows...

```solidity
function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    if (!currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) {
        revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, from, to);
    }
}

function checkedTransfer(IERC20 currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    if (!currency.transfer(to, amount)) {
        revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, address(this), to);
    }
}
```

These functions check that the return value of the executed transfer is `true`. However, some tokens like USDT do not return a value on successful transfers. This results in the transfers failing and therefore, unsupported tokens.

## Impact

This issues works against the protocols goal of supporting all ERC-20 tokens. Users are not able to use this class of tokens as loan assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Relaxing the check will enable the contract to support tokens that do not return a value on successful transfers. 

For reference, OpenZeppelinâ€™s `SafeERC20`, with the `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom`, functions handles this return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
