# Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom instead of transfer/transferFrom

## Summary

The contract Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol use the call functions transfer() and transferFrom() when transferring ERC20 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

Tokens not compliant with the ERC20 specification could return false from the transfer function call to indicate the transfer fails,  while the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return value is not checked. 

Checking the return value is a requirement, as written in the EIP-20 specification:
'Callers MUST handle false from returns (bool success). Callers MUST NOT assume that false is never returned!'

## Impact

The transfer could fail and but the 'checkedTransfer' functions will not notice the failure.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/utils/Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol#L9-L19

```solidity
    function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, from, to);
        }
    }

    function checkedTransfer(IERC20 currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!currency.transfer(to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, address(this), to);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend using the SafeERC20 library implementation from OpenZeppelin 
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol
and calling safeTransfer or safeTransferFrom when transferring ERC20 tokens.
