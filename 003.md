# No Check for ERC20 min loan and borrow offers can result in a DOS attack

## Summary
The protocol has an Admin facet that allows the owner to set a minoffercost for certain ERC20 tokens. However, it does not check if an ERC20 token has a minoffercost. That means that a user can still start DDOS attack, spam loan offers and break gas limit.


## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol has an Admin Facet where the owner set the minoffercost for an ERC20 loan offer shown here:

The owner also has the ability to set the min borrow amount shown here:

However, there is no check if a loan offer has a minoffercost shown here: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/Signature.sol#L27-L29

Also, there is no check that an ERC20 also has set borrow amount shown here:

Therefore a user can spam loan offers, increasing the protocol storage shown here, resulting in a DOS attack shown here:

## Impact
A malicious user can DDOS attack the protocol so it can't be used

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Since the protocol is designed to be permissionless, a possible mitigation attempt would be to add a limit to the amount of loan offers a user can accept or allow a minimum amount for borrowers to borrow from a loan offer.
