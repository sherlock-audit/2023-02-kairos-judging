# A malicious signer can exploite reentrancy while Borrowing

## Summary
In the Borrow process, I found a possible reentrancy attack here in `useOffer()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the normal borrowing process, it calls `useOffer()` in BorrowHandler.sol.  In `useOffer()` It mints NFT's using safeMint for signer .  As we know that safeMint call onERC721Received() before minting NFT. malicious signer can write exploit in `onERC721Received()` to exploite reentrancy here . attacker can again call `borrow()` to borrow another loan . If this happens it will mess-ups order of  position id and some other's id like loan id.
POC:
1) Bob borrow Money using `borrow()` in BorrowFacet.
2) ` borrow()` will further call `useCollateral()` in BorrowHandler.sol which will further triggers  `useOffer()`.
3) In `useOffer()` after all the validations it will call safeMint to mint NFT for the signer.  
4) Now safeMint will trigger `onERC721Received()` in signers contract which will again calls `borrow()`  to borrow some tokens . may be attacker can call `borrow()` multiple times . To change the order of id's
  
## Impact
This reentrancy messes with the loanId of the supply position as you saw in the loan as well, firstPositionId won't be correctly written Also the assumption that the ids are in order is broken.
