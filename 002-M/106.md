# The useLoan() function (Dutch auction) will fail for some tokens when the price of the NFT becomes zero.

## Summary
The ``useLoan()`` function (Dutch auction) might fail for some tokens when the price of the NFT becomes zero.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ``useLoan()`` function allows a user to liquidate a loan by buying the collateral NFT in the Dutch auction. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L59-L73](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L59-L73)

The price of the NFT will decrease from an initial price to ZERO after loan.auction.duration.

Unfortunately, the following code might fail for some tokens that will revert at a zero amount transfer (some tokens will revert when transferring zero amount: [https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers)

```javascript
uint256 toPay = price(arg.loanId);

        /* store as liquidated and paid before transfers to avoid malicious reentrency, following
        checks-effects-interaction pattern */
        loan.payment.liquidated = true;
        loan.payment.paid = toPay;
        loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toPay);
        loan.collateral.implem.safeTransferFrom(address(this), arg.to, loan.collateral.id);
```
This is because when NFT price is zero, ``toPay = 0``. 

As a result, the loan cannot be liquidated any more once the price reaches zero. 

## Impact
The The useLoan() function (Dutch auction) might fail for some tokens when the price of the NFT becomes zero. As a result, the loan cannot be liquidated anymore after a failing auction.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We can add an if statement so that the implementation will conform the spec, anybody can claim the NFT after the prize becomes zero.

```diff
    function useLoan(BuyArg memory arg) internal {
        Loan storage loan = protocolStorage().loan[arg.loanId];

        checkLoanStatus(arg.loanId);
        uint256 toPay = price(arg.loanId);

        /* store as liquidated and paid before transfers to avoid malicious reentrency, following
        checks-effects-interaction pattern */
        loan.payment.liquidated = true;
        loan.payment.paid = toPay;
-        loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toPay);
+      if(toPay > 0) loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toPay);
        loan.collateral.implem.safeTransferFrom(address(this), arg.to, loan.collateral.id);

        emit Buy(arg.loanId, abi.encode(arg));
    }
```
