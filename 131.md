# USDT cannot/should not be used as lent asset

## Summary

The documentation does not talk about which ERC20 cannot be used as assets. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Right now, the issue is labeled medium, because borrowers cannot borrow USDT due to https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowHandlers.sol#L88 but if this is upgraded in the future, then the vulnerability is severe.

When the loan lent is in USDT and the loan is not repaid, then the NFT will get locked on to the platform (nobody can buy, even at price zero). This is because of the following line
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L69
with the issue that some ERC20s (including USDT) do not return a success value on transferFrom.

## Impact

Users who do not repay loan on time may think they can always buy the NFT back at auction time (may be even at a premium), but this may not be possible if the loan asset is in USDT.

## Recommendation

check for currency (e.g., is it USDT?) before calling checkedTransferFrom.
