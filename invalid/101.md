# Add Token Allowlist if Any Tokens Should Not Be Used

## Summary
It's listed that this system is not to use ERC777 and other tokens. ERC677, for example, could lead to vulnerabilities based on the calls it makes when it transfers (shown in another bug report). If you still allow any tokens to be used within the system, it could lead to more vulnerabilities that have not yet been found.

## Vulnerability Detail
Slight vulnerabilities already discovered with the lack of checks, more may be possible. Exposing the system to re-entrancies is the biggest danger here.

## Impact
Medium

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        if (arg.offer.assetToLend != collatState.assetLent) {
            // all offers used for a collateral must refer to the same erc20
            revert InconsistentAssetRequests(collatState.assetLent, arg.offer.assetToLend);
        }
```

This checks that the assets for each user are equal, but not that they do or don't have any particular qualities.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an allowlist for tokens that may be used in the system.
