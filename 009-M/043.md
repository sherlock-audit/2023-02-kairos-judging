# The init() function can be called by anyone

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
The Init() function in the Initializer can be called by anyone when the contract has not yet been initialized.
## Impact
## Code Snippet
[Initializer.sol#L24](https://github.com/kairos-loan/kairos-contracts/blob/b2fd98d62cf0f25ee1db2bd551cd7b4606a5a988/src/Initializer.sol?plain=1#L24)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a control that makes init() only call by the Deployer Contract or EOA
```solidity
 if (msg.sender != DEPLOYER_ADDRESS) {
            revert NotDeployer();
        }
```
