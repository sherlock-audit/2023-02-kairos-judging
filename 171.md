# lender gets minInterestsToRepay / loan.nbOfPositions

## Summary

There are several instances in the docs where it is said that lenders get minInterestsToRepay as a anti ddos measure to prevent spam. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/ClaimFacet.sol#L99
we see that lenders only get `(minInterestsToRepay / loan.nbOfPositions)`. If the borrower spams with a lot of loan positions that he himself submits as a loan offer, then the honest lender only gets very low interest and then it is not clear if the gas costs justify claiming the interest. 

## Impact

The anti-ddos measure is not as effective as claimed.
