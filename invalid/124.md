# Missing two-step transfer ownership pattern

## Summary
Kairos Loan uses `OwnershipFacet` provided by the `diamond` package that implements simple one-step transfer of ownership.

## Vulnerability Detail
Ownership transfer is a critical operation and transferring it to an inaccessible wallet by mistake can effectively lock the contract forever.

## Impact

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/utils/FuncSelectors.h.sol#L40-L47

```solidity
function ownershipFS() pure returns (bytes4[] memory) {
    bytes4[] memory functionSelectors = new bytes4[](2);

    functionSelectors[0] = OwnershipFacet.transferOwnership.selector;
    functionSelectors[1] = OwnershipFacet.owner.selector;

    return functionSelectors;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Because the `diamond` package does not provide such implementation, it has to be developed in-house. For
inspiration LiFi's OwnershipFacet can be considered - https://github.com/lifinance/contracts/blob/e4eaa4dde816e66fe70c21ed9cc345b5fcbe53a1/src/Facets/OwnershipFacet.sol
