# ERC20's that have taxes on transfer can break the contract and get the tokens stuck into the contract

## Summary
If a lender wants to lend a token that has taxes on transfers it can break the logic of the contract and get the tokens stuck because the contract will not have enough tokens to transfer to the lender
## Vulnerability Detail
Simple POC : 
1. lender creates an offer and want to lend 1000 tokens of an ERC20 that takes 5% taxes on each transfer
2. a borrower comes in and borrow the tokens, putting his NFT as collateral, but the amount of tokens that he will get after `checkedTransferFrom` is 950, since 5% was taken for taxes. The contract stores the lent amount in the `initializedLoan` function as 1000 tokens since it takes into account the `amount` that the lender set in the offer
3. the borrow repays the 1000 tokens loan with 100 tokens of interest ( * *for this example we have 100 tokens as the interest amount* *)
4. the contract stores in the `loan.payment.paid` the amount to repay, which is 1100 in our case, but after the `checkedTransferFrom` the contract only gets 1045, since 5% of the total transfer was taken for taxes.
5. the lender call the `claim` function but the contract will revert since the value that needs to be transferred is ~1100 but the contract only has 1045 of that specific ERC20 token, which will led to tokens being stuck in the contract and the lender loosing his assets
The only way that the tokens can get unstuck is if other lenders lend the same ERC20 tokens ,in that case there are more tokens in the contract, but that would mean that there will still be lenders that will remain without their assets since the contract doesn't have enough tokens to pay every lender
## Impact
This issue is a High Severity issue since the user can lose their assets using the protocol, if they are not aware of that

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are multiple solution to this problem, one would be to do some internal accounting of the balances into the contract and change the storage variables of the amount `lent` and `loan.payment.paid` only after the transfer, counting only the amount that the contract got  or specify to the users the risk of using such tokens into the protocol.
