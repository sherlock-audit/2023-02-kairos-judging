# Transfers with USDT-like tokens will always revert

## Summary
USDT transfer always return false, even if successful. Protocol doesn't handle this behavior, resulting in revert

## Vulnerability Detail
Internal library used for ERC20 transfers will always revert
```solidity
library Erc20CheckedTransfer {
    function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, from, to);
        }
    }

    function checkedTransfer(IERC20 currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!currency.transfer(to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, address(this), to);
        }
    }
}
```

## Impact
It prevents users from using USDT and some other tokens, which is not intended by protocol I believe.
