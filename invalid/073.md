# DDoS protection for claims after repayment are minimal for non protected ERC20s

## Summary

DDoS, where borrowers spam the creation of supply positions not worth to claim by lenders from a gas cost perspective after a repayment, is still vulnerable for ERC20 that is not initialized with `minOfferCost` value.

## Vulnerability Detail

Kairos stated in docs that it was permissionless about which ERC20s can be lent, and it has some protection for DDoS by initializing `minOfferCost[currency]` via `setMinOfferCost()` called by admin. While it does protect the listed ERC20, the protection for non listed is 0 which is very minimal.


## Impact

DDOS is still possible with very minimal protection for claims after repayment using non protected ERC20.

Also maintaining list of selected ERC20s with anti DDOS system while the other not at all could defeat the purpose of permissionless ERC20s selection.

Note :

I also submit DDoS protection issues for claim after liquidation in separate submission, while seems like a duplicate, the main reason is that it is 2 different protection, maintained by 2 different state, checked in 2 different place for 2 different scenario (repayment and liquidation).

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AdminFacet.sol#L64-L67

function used by admin to initialize anti DDOS for claims after repayment for selected ERC20.

```solidity
    function setMinOfferCost(IERC20 currency, uint256 newMinOfferCost) external onlyOwner {
        protocolStorage().minOfferCost[currency] = newMinOfferCost;
        emit NewMininimumOfferCost(currency, newMinOfferCost);
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowHandlers.sol#L180

```solidity
    notPaid.minInterestsToRepay = nbOfOffers * proto.minOfferCost[collatState.assetLent];
```

then it will be used to protect against DDOS, but if not initialized the `notPaid.minInterestsToRepay` will be 0.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

for uninitialized `proto.minOfferCost[collatState.assetLent]`, try to use the percentage of loaner defined `loanToValue` to set the minimum amount.

```solidity     
  function initializedLoan(
        CollateralState memory collatState,
        address from,
        NFToken memory nft,
        uint256 nbOfOffers,
        uint256 lent,
        uint256 firstSupplyPositionId,
        uint256 loanToValue // add to param
    ) internal view returns (Loan memory) {
        Protocol storage proto = protocolStorage();

        .........

       // if proto.minOfferCost[collatState.assetLent is 0, try to set to the defined percentage of `loanToValue` (0.5% for instance)
       if (proto.minOfferCost[collatState.assetLent] = 0) {
            notPaid.minInterestsToRepay = nbOfOffers * (loanToValue * 5 / 1000); 
       }   else {
           notPaid.minInterestsToRepay = nbOfOffers * proto.minOfferCost[collatState.assetLent];
       }

       ........
    }

```
