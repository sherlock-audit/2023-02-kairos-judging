# The admin can manipulate the auction duration right before any borrowing, then claim the NFT (collateral) for free in case it goes into a liquidation status

## Summary
The admin can manipulate the auction duration right before any borrowing, then claim the NFT (collateral) for free in case it goes into a liquidation status.

## Vulnerability Detail
Admin can set the auction duration, and according to the comments above the `AdminFacet.setAuctionDuration` method: 
> sets the time it takes to auction prices to fall to 0 for future loans.

This means, if the duration ends, the NFT could be claimed for free.
Additionally, the admin is a trusted actor to set the auction duration for future loans, and if a lender (or a borrower) isn't satisfied with the current duration set by the admin, then they can simply stop using the protocol or keep using it while taking the risk of having the auction duration for example too short.

However, the admin can manipulate the auction duration (e.g. setting it to zero) for any on-going borrowing transaction by front-running it, and then set the duration back to its old value after the borrowing finished. Later, if the NFT (collateral) goes to a liquidation status, it can be available right away to be claimed for free. Thus, the admin can claim the NFT (collateral) for free resulting in a loss of the funds that should be claimed by the lender in the first place.

In short, in case of a liquidation status of any loan, the admin could possibly gain the NFT (collateral) for free.

Note: although the admin is a trusted actor, the protocol shouldn't allow such a case where the admin can steal the NFTs (collaterals) without even upgrading the protocol.

## Impact
- The NFT (used as a collateral) could possibly be stolen without even upgrading the protocol.
- Lender loses the funds that's gotten from selling the NFT (collateral) in case the loan goes into a liquidation status.

### PoC
Given:
Bob is a lender
Alice is a borrower
Admin is a kairos admin

Imagine the following scenario
1. Admin is monitoring the mempool.
2. Alice picks an offer signed by Bob.
3. Alice sends a borrowing transaction.
4. Admin front runs it and sends a `setAuctionDuration`  transaction with zero value.
5. `setAuctionDuration`  transaction is finished and the auction duration is set to zero.
6. Alice's borrowing transaction is finished now.
7. Alice's loan has auction duration as zero.
8. Admin sets auction duration to its old value.
9. Now everything is back to normal, but in case the NFT (collateral) goes into a liquidation status, the admin can claim it for free immediately.

Note: this impacts the borrower as well in case he/she has a share of the NFT sale.

## Code Snippet
```sh
    /// @notice sets the time it takes to auction prices to fall to 0 for future loans
    /// @param newAuctionDuration number of seconds of the duration
    function setAuctionDuration(uint256 newAuctionDuration) external onlyOwner {
        protocolStorage().auction.duration = newAuctionDuration;
        emit NewAuctionDuration(newAuctionDuration);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are many possibilities to mitigate this risk
1. For example, include the auction duration as a part of the offer signed by the lender optionally. and if it is not set, then take the duration set by the admin as a default.
2. An easier and simpler solution, is to require a minimum duration, for example 3 days. Thus, the admin can not set less than a 3 days protecting the lenders from the issue described above.
