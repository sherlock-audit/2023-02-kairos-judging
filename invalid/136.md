# Unimported libraries for initialization

## Summary
Unimported libraries for initialization


## Vulnerability Detail
The contract declaration doesn't inherit the imported libraries for initialization.

## Impact
If one of the above is used to utilize the diamond upgradeability functionality, the protocol will not be initialized.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
Contract Initializer.sol

Contract Initializer is .... {

}
```

## Tool used
VS Code

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refactor to this:

```solidity
Contract Initializer is "LibDiamond" {

}
```
Please make sure that if you intend to use the Diamond Proxy upgradeability functionality, 
that you import the above contracts and inherit them in the contract declaration.
Also, follow the right procedure workflow as noted below:

The Diamond initialization workflow:

Deploy the initialization contract, DiamondInit.
Deploy the implementation contracts.
Deploy the Diamond.
Execute diamondCut() function.
Mapping is upgraded by adding function selectors and facet addresses.
The _calldata argument is executed with delegatecall on DiamondInit (same transaction)
Diamond state variables are initialized.
The Diamond deployment is complete.
