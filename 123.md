# minting SupplyPosition NFT to loan supplier doesn't emit event required by EIP

## Summary
Kairos loan market relies heavily on off-chain monitors that listen to various events, including a `Transfer` event on mint which is required by EIP721

## Vulnerability Detail
Not receving this event  (required by EIP) may result in irrational/unwanted decision-making by Kairos loan suppliers, which will make the protocol look bad and lose trustworthiness in the eyes of the suppliers misguided by false promises that the protocol is ERC721-compliant

## Impact
Suppliers will expect this event as per EIP and not receiving it may surprise them.
