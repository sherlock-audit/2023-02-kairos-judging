# Permanent Denial Of Service: Non-standard tokens which don't return true on transfer() break auction, borrow, repay & claim

## Summary
Kairos explicitly aims to support any ERC20 token, however some ERC20 tokens (eg: [USDT Tether](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)) don't return true from a successful transfer() which breaks core Kairos features such as Auction, Repay, Borrow & Claim.

This is worthwhile to be regarded as at least medium severity because it is a permanent denial-of-service from users attempting to use the prominent USDT stablecoin (and other similar non-standard ERC20s) with the Kairos platform, which is contrary to Kairos' explicit aim to support any ERC20 token. It is very reasonable to believe that Kairos wants users to be able to offer USDT loans on their platform & didn't intend to permanently deny them service.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
[Erc20CheckedTransfer.checkedTransferFrom() & checkedTransfer() ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/utils/Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol#L9-L18) revert if true isn't returned, but some ERC20 tokens won't return true even though the transfer was successful. Reverts will occur in:

-  [AuctionFacet.sol L69](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L69), 
- [RepayFacet.sol L57](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/RepayFacet.sol#L57) 
- [BorrowHandlers.sol L88](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowHandlers.sol#L88)
- ClaimFacet [L83](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/ClaimFacet.sol#L83), [L105](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/ClaimFacet.sol#L105), [L118](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/ClaimFacet.sol#L118)

## Impact
Permanent denial of service to users of USDT & other non-standard ERC20 tokens which don't return true after a successful transfer, due to Auction, Repay, Borrow & Claim reverting when used with USDT & other non-standard ERC20 tokens.

## Code Snippet
Add attached file MissingReturnToken.txt to mock directory & rename to .sol

In Borrow.t.sol, add following imports:

```solidity
import {Money} from "../../src/mock/Money.sol";
import {MissingReturnToken} from "../../src/mock/MissingReturnToken.sol";
```

Then add the test function:

```solidity
function testBorrowMissingReturnToken() public {
    MissingReturnToken mrt = new MissingReturnToken();
    money = Money(address(mrt));

    borrowNTimes(1);
}
```

Then execute the test:

```solidity
forge test --match "MissingReturnToken" -vvv
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One possibility may be to use SafeERC20. In Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol :

```solidity
import {SafeERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

library Erc20CheckedTransfer {
    function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(currency, from, to, amount);
    }

    function checkedTransfer(IERC20 currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(currency, to, amount);
    }
}
```
