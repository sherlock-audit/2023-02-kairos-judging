# Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom for ERC20 tokens

## Summary

Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom for ERC20 tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol uses checkedTransferFrom / checkedTransfer for transfer of ERC20 tokens, 

```solidity
ClaimFacet.sol

                loan.assetLent.checkedTransfer(msg.sender, sentTemp);
```
```solidity
RepayFacet.sol

            loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toRepay);
```

which calls transfer/transferFrom.

```solidity
Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol

    function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, from, to);
        }
    }


    function checkedTransfer(IERC20 currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!currency.transfer(to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, address(this), to);
        }
    }
```

Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false (e.g. [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code)). https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20/#no-revert-on-failure tranfser/transferfrom is directly used to send tokens in many places in the contract and the return value is not checked. If the token send fails, it will cause a lot of serious problems. This is an issue since the protocol allows any ERC20 tokens to be the lending token, and there are many weird erc20 tokens.

## Impact

If the token send fails, it will cause a lot of serious problems. For example, in the repay function, if lent token is ZRX, the lender can get his NFT back without providing any tokens.

## Recommendation

Consider using safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently. Use OpenZeppelin's Safetransfer library to handle transfer functions appropriately.
