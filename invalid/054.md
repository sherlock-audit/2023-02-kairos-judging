# `Price` Precision May Be Lost

## Summary
`Price` Precision May Be Lost
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `AuctionFacet::price` contract, the final operation on the price is as follows:
```solidity
uint256 estimatedValue = loan.lent.mul(ONE.div(loan.shareLent)); //@audit
return estimatedValue.mul(loan.auction.priceFactor).mul(decreasingFactor);
```
Equivalent to
```solidity
loan.lent.mul(ONE.div(loan.shareLent)).mul(loan.auction.priceFactor).mul(decreasingFactor)

loan.lent * (one / loan.shareLent) * loan.auction.priceFactor * decreasingFactor
```
For solidity multiplication and division operations, we recommend moving the division to the last step of the calculation, because if we move the division forward, it may cause the final result to lose precision.
