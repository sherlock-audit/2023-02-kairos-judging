# The repay-claim workflow will drain the protocol for the fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
The repay-claim workflow will not work for the fee-on-transfer tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The ``repay()`` function allows a borrower to repay his debt:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/RepayFacet.sol#L24-L61](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/RepayFacet.sol#L24-L61)

After that, the lender/supplier can call ``claim()`` to claim both the lent principal plus interests:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/ClaimFacet.sol#L25-L53](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/ClaimFacet.sol#L25-L53)

However, for [the fee-on-transfer tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer), the following repayment will not result in the contract  receiving ``toRpay`` amount, but less than this amount.

```javascript
            toRepay = lent + interests;
            loan.payment.paid = toRepay;
            loan.payment.borrowerClaimed = true;
            loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toRepay);
            loan.collateral.implem.safeTransferFrom(address(this), loan.borrower, loan.collateral.id);
```

As a result, ``claim()`` will claim more than what the contract received, the contract will be drained little by little by such difference, leading to unhealthy lending economy. At some point, the protocol will break when there is not sufficient tokens to claim. 

## Impact

The repay-claim workflow will introduce a deficit for the contract for  the fee-on-transfer tokens and as a result, the protocol will be drained little by little until it breaks.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check both the balance before and after the transfer during ``repay()`` and make sure the actual received payment is no less than ``toRepay``.
