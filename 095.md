# Slipping through minimun interests due to front run

## Summary
Protocols are set to minimum interest as a DDos measure. However, because it is set for each currency, if a currency that has not yet been used is used for a loan ahead of time, the minimum interest will be set as zero.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol sets the offer cost for each currency by `setMinOfferCost(IERC20 currency, uint256 newMinOfferCost)`. However, if the protocol has not yet set this, it will be zero and the appropriate minimum interest cannot be charged.
## Impact
The protocol wanted to prevent, DDos attacks are established.

## Recommendation
For example, allow the entire setup to be done before setting up each currency.
