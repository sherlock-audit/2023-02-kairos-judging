# Reentrancy attack in the `useLoan` function in the AuctionFacet.sol

## Summary
During the auction process, the `buy` function is called to transfer the ERC-721 token from the kairos contract to the caller of the function

## Vulnerability Detail

Specifically, an attacker could create a malicious contract that implements a fallback function, which would then be called when the `safeTransferFrom` function is executed in this line of code;

[`loan.collateral.implem.safeTransferFrom(address(this), arg.to, loan.collateral.id);`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L70)

The `safeTransferFrom` inherits from the `@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol` which implements the `_safeTransfer` internal function. This function triggers a callback into the caller contract using the `_checkOnERC721Received` check and can cause a reentrancy attack from the caller contract.

In the POC shown below in the `Code snippet`, the Malicious contract takes an instance of the IAuctionFacet contract as a parameter in its constructor. It then implements a fallback function that calls the useLoan function with a valid loan ID and the address of the Malicious contract as the recipient of the collateral. The startAttack function calls the fallback function repeatedly to trigger the reentrancy vulnerability.


## Impact
If the attacker's contract re-enters the useLoan function, it would execute the function again before the initial invocation of the function has been completed, leading to unexpected results and potentially harmful behavior.

## Code Snippet
Here is a proof of concept as it relates to the attack

```solidity
contract Malicious {
    IAuctionFacet auction;

    constructor(address _auction) {
        auction = IAuctionFacet(_auction);
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        BuyArg[] memory args = new BuyArg[](1);
        args[0] = BuyArg(0, address(this)); // replace 0 with a valid loan ID
        auction.buy(args);
    }

    function startAttack() external {
        // call the fallback function repeatedly to trigger the reentrancy vulnerability
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            (bool success, ) = address(auction).call(abi.encodeWithSignature("useLoan((uint256,address))", BuyArg(0, address(this))));
            require(success, "useLoan call failed");
        }
    }
}
```


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, you can add a reentrancy guard to the useLoan function, so that it can only be called once per transaction. This can be done by using a state variable to track whether the function is currently being executed and adding a require statement at the beginning of the function to check this variable.

Also, the noReentrant modifier can be implemented from the `@openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol`
