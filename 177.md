# BorrowFacet.sol: Using transferFrom on ERC721 tokens could lead users fund to be locked

## Summary

The contract BorrowFacet.sol use the call function transferFrom in the function borrow(), which is not adequate for ERC721 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function borrow() of contract BorrowFacet.sol, when sending borrowed tokens to caller, the transferFrom keyword is used instead of safeTransferFrom. 
If any caller is a contract and is not aware of incoming ERC721 tokens, the sent tokens could be locked.

## Impact

Lock of users fund.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowFacet.sol#L36-L43

```solidity
    /// @notice take loans, take ownership of NFTs specified as collateral, sends borrowed money to caller
    /// @param args list of arguments specifying at which terms each collateral should be used
    function borrow(BorrowArg[] calldata args) external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
            args[i].nft.implem.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), args[i].nft.id);
            useCollateral(args[i].args, msg.sender, args[i].nft);
        }
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider changing transferFrom to safeTransferFrom in line 40.

However, it could introduce a DoS attack vector if any caller maliciously rejects the received ERC721 tokens to make the others unable to get their tokens.

Alternatively we recommend to use a try/catch statement to handle error cases separately.
