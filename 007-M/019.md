# Pausable ERC20 tokens might break project's functionality

## Summary
Pausable ERC20 tokens (e.g. BNB) are not handled properly. If a token is paused during a loan/ auction both borrowers/ lenders might be forced to lose money.

## Vulnerability Detail
If a token is paused during a loan/ auction both borrowers/ lenders might be forced to lose money.
Assume Alice has borrowed ERC20 tokens (e.g. BNB) which are pausable and has given her NFT as collateral. Just before Alice pays back her loan, the token gets paused. The token doesn't get unpaused before the liquidation sale. Even though Alice had the tokens to repay and was willing to do so, she was forced to get liquidated, losing her NFT as colleteral. 
Furthermore, the auction for the NFT is happening with the same token that was used in the loan. If the token remains paused for the majority/ entirety of the auction, the NFT will sale for 0/ close to 0, forcing the lender to also lose most, if not all of the tokens they have lent.

## Impact
Forced loss for both Borrowers and Lenders

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement new logic for working with Pausable tokens (e.g. extend loan endDate by the time the ERC20 contract was paused)
