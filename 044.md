# Erc20CheckedTransfer Library Fails to Handle Non-Conforming ERC-20 Tokens

## Summary

Erc20CheckedTransfer Library Fails to Handle Non-Conforming ERC-20 Tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

The Erc20CheckedTransfer library is designed to provide safe ERC-20 token transfers by performing a check to ensure that transfers are successful before proceeding. However, the library fails to handle non-conforming ERC-20 tokens, such as USDT, that do not correctly implement the EIP20 standard. These tokens return void instead of a success boolean from their transfer/transferFrom functions. As a result, the checked functions in this library will always revert in such cases, rendering these tokens unusable in the protocol.

## Impact

Non-conforming ERC-20 Tokens will not be unable to be used on the protocol, as lenders will be unable to provide loans of those assets.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelin's [SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) library instead of the custom `Erc20CheckedTransfer`.
