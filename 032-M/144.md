# Liquidation occur at incorrect time

## Summary
Asset becomes liquidable at incorrect time. As per Storage.sol#L42 -

"@param endDate timestamp after which sale starts & repay is impossible" 

But it seems that asset becomes liquidable even at endDate which is incorrect and would lead user to lose collateral

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Lets say User A has a loan whose endDate is X
2. User plan to repay his loan at timestamp X
3. But Attacker can liquidate user at `endDate` because as per contract loan becomes liquidable at endDate which is incorrect as per docs

```solidity
function checkLoanStatus(uint256 loanId) internal view {
        Loan storage loan = protocolStorage().loan[loanId];

        if (block.timestamp < loan.endDate) {
            revert CollateralIsNotLiquidableYet(loan.endDate, loanId);
        }
...
}
```

## Impact
User assets become liquidable at unexpected time which may cause user to lose his collateral

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revise the condition like below:

```solidity
function checkLoanStatus(uint256 loanId) internal view {
        Loan storage loan = protocolStorage().loan[loanId];

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.endDate) {
            revert CollateralIsNotLiquidableYet(loan.endDate, loanId);
        }
...
}
```
