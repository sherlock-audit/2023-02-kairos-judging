# The lent amount check could be too harsh if the decimals of the lent token is too big.

## Summary

There is a check in `BorrowHandler.userCollateral()` to make sure that the calculation in `RepayFacet.repay()` won’t overflow. But it doesn’t consider the decimals of the lent token.

## Vulnerability Detail


There is a check in `BorrowHandler.userCollateral()` that the amount of lent cannot exceed 1e40.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowHandlers.sol#L119
```solidity
    function useCollateral(
        OfferArg[] memory args,
        address from,
        NFToken memory nft
    ) internal returns (Loan memory loan) {
        …

        // cf RepayFacet for the rationale of this check. We prevent repaying being impossible due to an overflow in the
        // interests to repay calculation.
        if (lent > 1e40) {
            revert UnsafeAmountLent(lent);
        }
        …
    }
```

But the check doesn’t consider the decimals of the lent token. If the decimals of the lent token is too big. Then the available amount of the lent token could be too small.

## Impact

The check could be too harsh for the lent token with bigger decimals.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Normalize the amount of lent tokens that have different decimals.
