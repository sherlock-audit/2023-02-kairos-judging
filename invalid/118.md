# Tokens will be irrecoverably stranded in the Kairos contract on some claims

## Summary

When a loan goes into liquidation, its collateral price is linearly decreased from the current debt down to zero. Along the way, certain points will have the lender claims rounded down such that some tokens are irrecoverably stranded in the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider a situation where a borrower uses their NFT collateral to borrow from three loan offers in proportion of 33/33/33 tokens, for a total of 99 units of the lent token borrowed. If this borrower goes into liquidation and the collateral falls down to the price of 92 units before being sold, each lender will have a claim to 30 units of the lent token. The final 2 units are not sent to any lender and cannot be claimed from the protocol.

## Impact

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Send all remaining debt tokens to the final lender to claim, as the rounding difference will be small.
