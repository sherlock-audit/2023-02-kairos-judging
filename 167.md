# `Erc20CheckedTransfer` functions do not work with `USDT` and `BNB`, which leads to frozen funds of lenders in the case of `BNB`.

## Summary
Because of how `Erc20CheckedTransfer` functions are handling transfers, lending will not work for `USDT`, and will lead to lenders losing their funds for `BNB`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Both functions of the library are used to perform transfers of principal and interests throughout the protocol 

```solidity
File: src/utils/Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol
9: function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
10:         if (!currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) {
11:             revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, from, to);
12:         }
13:     }
14: 
15:     function checkedTransfer(IERC20 currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
16:         if (!currency.transfer(to, amount)) {
17:             revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, address(this), to);
18:         }
19:     }
```

The issue is that it checks the return value of `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` call.
Some tokens do not return a value on these calls (notably `USDT` and `BNB`), which will make the calls revert.

## Impact

- Case `loan.assetLent == USDT`:

Neither `transfer()` nor `transferFrom()` return a bool, meaning it is impossible to lend/borrow this token using Kairos.

- Case `loan.assetLent == BNB`:

`transferFrom()` returns a bool, but `transfer()` does not:

- Alice is a lender and signs an offer to lend `100 BNB` against a NFT `XYZ` of `tokenId == i`.
- Bob matches this offer by calling `BorrowFacet.borrow()`. He receives `100 BNB` in `BorrowHandlers.useOffer()` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowHandlers.sol#L88).
- Bob repays his loan after a while, calling `RepayFacet.repay()`, which transfers the `100 BNB` back in the Kairos contract. (we ignore interests for the sake of this example as it is not relevant)
- Alice can now claim back her `100 BNB` by calling `ClaimFacet.claim()`. The call will revert [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/ClaimFacet.sol#L105) because `BNB.transfer()` does not return a boolean.

Alice can never retrieve her `100 BNB`


Note: While Kairos mentions it only supports tokens that fully implement `ERC20`:
```c
Kairos is permissionless when it comes to which ERC721s and which ERC20s can be used in the protocol, considering it is the responsibility of the lenders and borrowers not to interact with non-compliant implementations of those standards
```

Here the issue arises with `USDT` and `BNB`, ie the 3rd and 4th largest market caps of the crypto market.
Not supporting these tokens would put Kairos at a severe disadvantage compared to other lending protocols.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `Erc20CheckedTransfer` functions so that they use OpenZeppelin's [safeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) library, which will handle the cases of `USDT` and `BNB`.
