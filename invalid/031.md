# The excess assets will be locked in the contract and cannot be withdrawn.

## Summary
Due to the difference in precision when calculating shares, there may be excess assets left in the contract, and currently there is no function to extract them.
## Vulnerability Detail
`RayMath` was used to calculate the shares in both `borrow` and `claim`, with the following code.
https://github.com/kairos-loan/kairos-contracts/blob/main/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowHandlers.sol#L91
```solidity
safeMint(signer, Provision({amount: arg.amount, share: shareMatched, loanId: collatState.loanId}));
```
https://github.com/kairos-loan/kairos-contracts/blob/main/src/ClaimFacet.sol#L117
```solidity
sent = loan.payment.paid.mul(provision.share);
```

`RayMath` involves rounding operations, but the actual change in asset quantity during transfer does not use RayMath, which results in discrepancies.

For example, an NFT collateral worth 3e8, borrowed 2e8 from A and 1e8 from B. Then the borrower repays the loan normally, and A and B claim respectively. After calculation, the actual sum of A's and B's claims is less than the total repayment amount.

Add the following test code in `RayMath.t.sol`:

```solidity
function testMulDiv() public {
        uint256 nftvalue = 3e8;
        uint256 aBorrow = 2e8;
        uint256 bBorrow = 1e8;
        Ray colMatched;

        Ray aShare = aBorrow.div(nftvalue);
        colMatched = colMatched.add(aShare);
        Ray bShare = bBorrow.div(nftvalue);
        colMatched = colMatched.add(bShare);
        assertFalse(colMatched.gt(ONE));
        assertTrue(colMatched.eq(ONE));
        
        uint256 interest = 1e2;
        uint256 nftsold = nftvalue + interest;
        assertEq(nftsold.mul(aShare) + nftsold.mul(bShare), nftsold);
    }
```
```shell

```

It can be seen that the actual sum of claims made by A and B is less than the total repayment amount. These extra assets cannot be extracted at present and will be locked in the contract.
## Impact
There may be excess assets left in the contract, and currently there is no function to extract them.
