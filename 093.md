# USDT cannot be used

## Summary
Using USDT as ERC20 produces an error.
## Vulnerability Detail
USDT is well known as a currency that does not return a bool value when transferring. Therefore, it is out of the IERC20 standard and cannot be used in this project. However, at the same time, since there are many users, it is considered necessary to take countermeasures.
## Impact
Lose gas money every time you call because the transaction fails.
## Code Snippet
`if (!currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) `
