# Repaying multiple loans could run into DoS issue

## Summary
When paying multiple loans by calling `repay()`, users’ transaction could revert if one of the positions happens to be liquidated slightly earlier by a concurrent transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is a possible scenario:

1. Alice attempts to pay 15 loans of which 3 of them have been liquidatable.
2. Meanwhile, Bob submits a transaction wishing to buy one of Alice’s collaterals.
3. Due to on chain congestion, Bob happens to outrun Alice’s transaction.
4. Alice’s call reverts when the affected iteration runs into loan.payment.liquidated.

## Impact
Alice wasted her effort on top of the gas incurred. Additionally, she could run into the same issue if the above scenario were to transpire again, adding more losses from more inadvertently liquidated positions by others.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider refactoring the affected `repay()` such that the for loop continues to the next iteration if it runs into a true condition  in the if block:

```diff

            if (loan.payment.paid > 0 || loan.payment.borrowerClaimed || loan.payment.liquidated) {
-                revert LoanAlreadyRepaid(loanIds[i]);
+                continue;
            }

```
