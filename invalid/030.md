# Hacked or Malicious owner can cause potential DoS on repay function

## Summary
Lenders can be DoSed due to malicious or hacked admin leading to them not incentivized to claim repayments

## Vulnerability Detail
Even though there is a check to make sure of the minimum borrowed amount is borrowed, there could still be a possible DoS attack due to unbounded array length of loadIds in `repay()` function.

Since minimum amount to borrow is set by admin, in the event that owner of the kairos contract is hacked, they can purposely set or change the minimum offer cost and borrow amount per offer lower bound to a very low value for lenders using `AdminFacet.setMinOfferCost()` and `AdminFacet.setBorrowAmountPerOfferLowerBound()` respectively.

Attacker/malicious owner can then immediately use a malicious borrower account to cause DoS by spamming borrow positions using the `BorrowFacet.borrow` function that is not worth it for lenders to collect in terms of gas cost using the `ClaimFacet.claim()` function.

## Impact
Lenders can be DoSed due to malicious or hacked admin setting very low values for minimum offer cost and
borrow amount per offer lower bound using `AdminFacet.setMinOfferCost()` and `AdminFacet.setBorrowAmountPerOfferLowerBound()` respectively, leading to them not incentivized to claim repayments using `ClaimFacet.claim()` due to gas fees.

```solidity
/RepayFacet.sol
24:    function repay(uint256[] memory loanIds) external {
25:        Protocol storage proto = protocolStorage();
26:        Loan storage loan;
27:        uint256 lent;
28:        uint256 interests;
29:        uint256 toRepay;
30:
31:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < loanIds.length; i++) {
32:            loan = proto.loan[loanIds[i]];
33:            // loan.payment.paid may be at 0 and considered repaid in case of an auction sale executed at price 0
34:            if (loan.payment.paid > 0 || loan.payment.borrowerClaimed || loan.payment.liquidated) {
35:                revert LoanAlreadyRepaid(loanIds[i]);
36:            }
37:            lent = loan.lent;
38:            /* if the linear interests are very low due to a short time elapsed, the minimal interests amount to repay
39:            is applied as an anti ddos mechanism */
40:            interests = RayMath.max(
41:                /* during the interests calculus, we can consider that (block.timestamp - loan.startDate)
42:                won't exceed 1e10 (>100 years) and interest per second (unwrapped value) won't exceed
43:                1e27 (corresponding to an amount to repay doubling after 1 second), we can deduce that
44:                (loan.interestPerSecond.mul(block.timestamp - loan.startDate)) is capped by 1e10 * 1e27 = 1e37
45:                we want to avoid the interests calculus to overflow so the result must not exceed 1e77
46:                as (1e77 < type(uint256).max). So we can allow `lent` to go as high as 1e40, but not above.
47:                This explains why borrowing throws on loan.lent > 1e40, as this realisticly avoids
48:                repaying being impossible due to an overflow. */
49:                /* the interest per second is a share of what has been lent to add to the interests each second. The
50:                next line accrues linearly */
51:                lent.mul(loan.interestPerSecond.mul(block.timestamp - loan.startDate)),
52:                loan.payment.minInterestsToRepay
53:            );
54:            toRepay = lent + interests;
55:            loan.payment.paid = toRepay;
56:            loan.payment.borrowerClaimed = true;
57:            loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toRepay);
58:            loan.collateral.implem.safeTransferFrom(address(this), loan.borrower, loan.collateral.id);
59:            emit Repay(loanIds[i]);
60:        }

## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
Add a timelock in `AdminFacet.setMinOfferCost()` and `AdminFacet.setBorrowAmountPerOfferLowerBound()` for lenders to react in the event this happens and establish an upper threshold for both minimum offer cost and borrow amount per offer lower bound. Also consider setting a limit for number of addresses that are able to repay one loan
