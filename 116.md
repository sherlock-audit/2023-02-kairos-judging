# Once a new tranche is created all the available offers are disabled

## Summary

The creation of new tranches can deactivate available offers.

## Vulnerability Detail

The borrower creates a list of offers that he will take a borrow and each offer is validated via the [BorrowCheckers.sol:checkOfferArg()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowCheckers.sol#L23) function. 

The admin can create new tranches via [AdminFacet.sol:createTranche()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AdminFacet.sol#L47) function.

The lenders can sign an offer with a valid tranche but when a new tranche is created via the ```BorrowCheckers.sol:checkOfferArg()```, that offer is disabled because the [validation:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowCheckers.sol#L48)
```solidity
if (arg.offer.tranche >= proto.nbOfTranches) {
```
checks that the ```offer.tranche``` is more than the total number of tranches.

Please see the next scenario:

1. The lenders sign offers with a tranche X.
2. The borrower has many offers and he is still waiting for more offers.
3. A new tranche is created and the offers that the borrower has now are disabled because the check ```if (arg.offer.tranche >= proto.nbOfTranches)```.
4. Borrower needs to get the new offers from each lender with the updated tranche.

## Impact

Valid offers are disabled because an update of the tranche.
- This affects the borrowers who needs to ask for signed offers with an updated tranche
- The lenders are affected who think that their offers are still available.

## Code Snippet

The [checkOfferArg()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowCheckers.sol#L23) function where the tranche is validated.

```solidity
function checkOfferArg(OfferArg memory arg) internal view returns (address signer) {
    Protocol storage proto = protocolStorage();

    /* it is statistically impossible to forge a signature that would lead to finding a signer that does not aggrees
    to the signed loan offer and that usage wouldn't revert due to the absence of approved funds to mobilize. This
    is how we know the signer address can't be the wrong one without leading to a revert. */
    signer = ECDSA.recover(offerDigest(arg.offer), arg.signature);

    /* we use a lower bound, I.e the actual amount must be strictly higher that this bound as a way to prevent a 0 
    amount to be used even in the case of an uninitialized parameter for a given erc20. This bound set by governance
    is used as an anti-ddos measure to prevent borrowers to spam the creation of supply positions not worth to claim
    by lenders from a gas cost perspective after a liquidation. more info in docs */
    uint256 amountLowerBound = proto.offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[arg.offer.assetToLend];

    if (!(arg.amount > amountLowerBound)) {
        revert RequestedAmountIsUnderMinimum(arg.offer, arg.amount, amountLowerBound);
    }
    /* the offer expiration date is meant to be used by lenders as a way to manage the evolution of market
    conditions */
    if (block.timestamp > arg.offer.expirationDate) {
        revert OfferHasExpired(arg.offer, arg.offer.expirationDate);
    }

    /* as tranches can't be deactivated, checking the number of tranches allows us to deduce if the tranche id is
    valid */
    if (arg.offer.tranche >= proto.nbOfTranches) {
        revert InvalidTranche(proto.nbOfTranches);
    }
}
```

The [createTranche()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AdminFacet.sol#L47) function

```solidity
function createTranche(Ray newTranche) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 newTrancheId) {
    Protocol storage proto = protocolStorage();

    newTrancheId = proto.nbOfTranches++;
    proto.tranche[newTrancheId] = newTranche;

    emit NewTranche(newTranche, newTrancheId);
}
```


## Tool used

Vscode

## Recommendation

Accepts the tranche that is signed and it is in the ```proto.tranche``` array.
