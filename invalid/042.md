# Possible DOS (out-of-gas)

## Summary
If the OfferArg[] array is very large, the loop function in the useCollateral() function can run out of gas.

## Vulnerability Detail
The internal function useCollateral() in BorrowHandlers.sol is a critical component of the protocol as it is used in sensitive functions such as onERC721Received() and borrow() in BorrowFacet. useCollateral() utilizes an unbounded array that loops through all OfferArg[] elements to update the variable "lent", which is used in the same function to update different states in the contracts.

## Impact
If the OfferArg[] memory args become too large, there is a high risk that the loops will run out of gas or exceed the block gas limit.
