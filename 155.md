# Some tokens doesn't return boolean value on ERC20 methods (transfer / transferFrom) resulting in revert a transfer

## Summary

Some tokens doesn't return boolean value on ERC20 methods (transfer / transferFrom) resulting in revert a valid transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens (like USDT) don’t correctly implement the EIP20 standard and their transfer/transferFrom functions return void, instead of a success boolean. Calling these functions with the correct EIP20 function signatures will always revert. https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#missing-return-values

Tokens that don’t correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec, like USDT, will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.

Kairos using `Erc20CheckedTransfer` contract for handling ERC20 transfer (checkedTransfer, checkedTransferFrom) which expecting a boolean return (true) when the transfer is success, otherwise it will revert.

## Impact

Some ERC20 which doesn't return boolean value on transfer will failed, and reverted.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/utils/Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol#L9-L19

```solidity
File: Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol
09:     function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
10:         if (!currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) {
11:             revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, from, to);
12:         }
13:     }
14: 
15:     function checkedTransfer(IERC20 currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
16:         if (!currency.transfer(to, amount)) {
17:             revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, address(this), to);
18:         }
19:     }
```

## Recommendation

We recommend using OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
