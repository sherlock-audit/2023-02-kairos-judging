# `minOfferCost` can be larger than `offerBorrowAmountLowerBound`, could lead to bad user experience.

## Summary

`minOfferCost` can be larger than `offerBorrowAmountLowerBound`, could lead to bad user experience.

## Vulnerability Detail

`minOfferCost` and `offerBorrowAmountLowerBound` are initialized for DDOS protection against dust claim after repayment and liquidation, but if not set and checked properly, `minOfferCost` can be larger than `offerBorrowAmountLowerBound` which could lead to honest borrower pay high loan interest unexpectedly. 

## Impact

honest borrower pay high loan interest unexpectedly, even when he/she repay it with time close to `loan.startDate`, and make loan offer using some ERC20s not appealing.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AdminFacet.sol#L64-L75

`setBorrowAmountPerOfferLowerBound()` used to update `offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[currency]` .

and `setMinOfferCost()` used to update minOfferCost[currency], but not checking the current value of `offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[currency]`, so minOfferCost[currency] can be larger than `offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[currency]`,.

```solidity
    /// @notice updates the minimum amount to repay per used loan offer when borrowing a certain currency
    /// @param currency the erc20 on which a new minimum borrow cost will take effect
    /// @param newMinOfferCost the new minimum amount that will need to be repaid per loan offer used
    function setMinOfferCost(IERC20 currency, uint256 newMinOfferCost) external onlyOwner {
        protocolStorage().minOfferCost[currency] = newMinOfferCost;
        emit NewMininimumOfferCost(currency, newMinOfferCost);
    }

    /// @notice updates the borrow amount lower bound per offer for one currency
    /// @param currency the erc20 on which a new borrow amount lower bound is taking effect
    /// @param newLowerBound the new lower bound
    function setBorrowAmountPerOfferLowerBound(IERC20 currency, uint256 newLowerBound) external onlyOwner {
        protocolStorage().offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[currency] = newLowerBound;
        emit NewBorrowAmountPerOfferLowerBound(currency, newLowerBound);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When `offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[currency]` is defined and is not 0, better to check so `minOfferCost[currency]` < `offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[currency]`

```solidity
    function setMinOfferCost(IERC20 currency, uint256 newMinOfferCost) external onlyOwner {
        // add additional check so `minOfferCost[currency]` < `offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[currency]`
        if (offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[currency] != 0 && newMinOfferCost > offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[currency]) {
        revert NotValidMinValue();
        }
        protocolStorage().minOfferCost[currency] = newMinOfferCost;
        emit NewMininimumOfferCost(currency, newMinOfferCost);
    }
```
