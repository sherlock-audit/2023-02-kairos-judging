# Buying multiple NFTs in liquidation can be exploited and run into DoS issue

## Summary
Buyers attempting to buy multiple NFTs can be played out by an attacker who will end up buying the list of liquidable NFTs one at a time at increasingly lower prices as [`timeSinceLiquidable`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L37) gets prolonged. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is a typical scenario:

1. Alice notices there are 10 positions that are liquidatable, and decides to liquidate them all by calling [`buy()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L25-L29) in AuctionFacet.sol.
2. Bob, upon seeing this intended attempt in the mempool, front runs Alice's transaction to buy one of the NFTs from Alice's list, presumably the one associated with the highest value in [`timeSinceLiquidable`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L43-L45).
3. Alice's transaction reverts because the position whose [`loadId`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L77) has been liquidated by Bob reverts in [`checkLoanStatus()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L83-L84).
4. Alice does not give up putting in another try to buy the rest of the liquidatable NFTs, but fails to do so again due to steps 2. and 3.

## Impact
Bob ended up playing out Alice by securing all the liquidatable positions, and would have spent more total amount of [`toPay`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L63) had he called `buy()` with the entire list of [`args`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/DataStructure/Objects.sol#L15-L18).

Alice wasted her effort on top of the gases incurred.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider inserting a pre-check similar to `checkLoanStatus()` in the `for loop` of `buy()` using `continue` prior to invoking [`useLoan()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L59):

[File: AuctionFacet.sol#L25-L29](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L25-L29)

```diff
     function buy(BuyArg[] memory args) external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
+            Loan storage loan = protocolStorage().loan[arg[i].loanId];
+            if (block.timestamp < loan.endDate || loan.payment.paid != 0 || loan.payment.liquidated) continue;
            useLoan(args[i]);
        }
    }
```
This will thwart Bob's malicious acts and allow the sincere buyer securing/liquidating all liquidatable positions in the args array.

Additionally, this will also help circumvent incidents where borrowers paying off their debts right before Aliceâ€™s transaction.
