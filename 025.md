# useLoan doesn't allow liqudator to specifiy maximum price

## Summary

useLoan doesn't allow the liquidator to specify a max price they are will to pay for the collateral they are liquidating. On the surface this doesn't seem like an issue because the price is always decreasing due to the dutch auction. However this can be problematic if the chain the contracts are deployed suffers a reorg attack. This can place the transaction earlier than anticipated and therefore charge the user more than they meant to pay. On Ethereum this is unlikely but this is meant to be deployed on any compatible EVM chain many of which are frequently reorganized.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
