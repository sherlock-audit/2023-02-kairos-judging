# Signers cannot revoke signatures, users could reuse signatures which signers do not want to lend again, the assets of signers may be stuck in the protocol.

## Summary

Signers cannot revoke signatures, users could reuse signatures which signers do not want to lend again, the assets of signers may be stuck in the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

There's no method for signers to revoke signatures, once a signer accidentally signs a long expirationDate, they are unable to revoke. The only way is to revoke token approvals, but this also affects that other signatures will also be revoked.

Another example is that if a signer signs many different `loanToValue` for the same NFT at different times. The signer will lose funds because borrowers can use old `loanToValue` which is higher than the real value of NFT.

## Impact

Signers cannot revoke signatures, the assets of signers may be stuck in the protocol.
