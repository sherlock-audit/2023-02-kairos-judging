# Claimable funds can be stuck in the contract

## Summary
As known in Kairos protocol system you can't claim your share unless you indeed has a supply position as NFT, without this NFT you can't claim any funds or shares etc.
</br>

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume there is an offer and Alex applied to it and get his loan now the whole process worked perfectly and Alex repaid his loan after a while before the loan end date.

Bob wants now to claim his share since he is the offer owner but unfortunately he can't because he lost his Supply position NFT for some reason. Indeed it's the Lender responsibility and now he lost his funds to claim in Kairos contract. 

as result we have funds stuck in the contract that even the Admin can't claim as well.
</br>

## Impact
more accidents would happened by transfer supply positions NFTs or trade them or get them lost. and with the time an amount of funds will stuck in the contract for ever which not being able to withdraw as well.
