# The NFT (collateral) could possibly get stuck in the protocol in some cases

## Summary
In case the assetToLend doesn't allow transfer 0 amount, the NFT (collateral) could possibly get stuck forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
In case the NFT (collateral) goes into a liquidation status, and the auction ends with no sale. The sale price will be zero (meaning you can claim it for free).
However, transferring assetToLend ERC20 is still performed even though the amount is zero.
The issue is that some ERC20 tokens don't allow transferring 0 amount. Thus, If the assetToLend ERC20 doesn't allow it, `buy` method will always revert resulting in the NFT stuck in the contract. 



## Impact

The NFT (collateral) is stuck in the protocol forever as there is no way to withdraw it other than `buy` method.

*Note: I've set the severity to high since the protocol supports any ERC20 token and there is no allowed list of ERC20 tokens.*

## Code Snippet


- Transferring assetToLend ERC20 has no zero check
```solidity
   loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toPay);

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Call transfer only if the amount greater than zero

For example:
```solidity
	if(toPay > 0){
	   loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toPay);
	}
```
