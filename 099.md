# No check for Mininteresttorepay results in a spam attack

## Summary
The function sendinterests performs a calculation to compute how much interest a supplier should have after a liquidation if  interests == loan.payment.minInterestsToRepay . However, there is a possibility of a precision loss in the calculation if there are too many offers.


## Vulnerability Detail
The calculation for interest when interests == loan.payment.minInterestsToRepay is as follows:

If there are too many offers, then interest is rounded down to 0 due to solidity not being able to divide properly



## Impact
A supplier can have his interest reduced due to precision loss
