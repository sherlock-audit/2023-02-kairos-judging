# Erc20CheckedTransfer relies on all ERC20 tokens returning a `bool` in the transfer function.

## Summary
`Erc20CheckedTransfer` relies on all ERC20 tokens returning a `bool` in the transfer function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Erc20CheckedTransfer` library has two functions (`checkedTransferFrom()` and `checkedTransfer()`) which rely on all ERC20 tokens returning a `bool` in the transfer function. There a number of ERC20 tokens which do not actually return `bool` in their `transfer()` function. A non-comprehensive list of those could be found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lukas-berlin/f587086f139df93d22987049f3d8ebd2/raw/1f937dc8eb1d6018da59881cbc633e01c0286fb0/Tokens%20missing%20return%20values%20in%20transfer).

## Impact
A user that interacts with the protocol with an ERC20 token that does not return a `bool` in its `transfer` function would result in a reverted transaction as the library reverts the transaction with a `ERC20TransferFailed` error.

The `Erc20CheckedTransfer` library is used and would impact the following contracts:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As per the [protocol documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos-marchev#on-chain-context), any ERC20 token is supported and thus proper handling should be put in place for those ERC20 tokens that do not return `bool` in their `transfer()` function.

A safe ERC20 transfer operation could be implemented using `call()` and checking the result of the call. Example:
