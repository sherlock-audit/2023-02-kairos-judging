# Precision loss in Function can lead to loss of funds or unfair market price of loan

## Summary
Precision loss in Function can lead to loss of funds or unfair market price of loan

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a danger here of precision loss due to the arithmetic.

In the line of code 
```solidity
uint256 estimatedValue = loan.lent.mul(ONE.div(loan.shareLent));, 
```
the expression ONE.div(loan.shareLent) performs an integer division operation. 
If loan.shareLent does not evenly divide into ONE, then the result of this division will be truncated, 
potentially causing a loss of precision.
For example, if ONE is defined as 1e18 and loan.shareLent is 3, then the result of the division will be 333333333333333333 (i.e., 1e18 / 3 = 333333333333333333.333... rounded down to the nearest integer). 
This means that the estimated value computed as loan.lent.mul(ONE.div(loan.shareLent)) will also be truncated, potentially resulting in a loss of precision.

## Impact

The impact on a user in this instance could be significant if the precision loss results in an 
incorrect price for the loan. This could potentially affect the ability of a user to liquidate 
the loan or purchase it at a fair market price, which may lead to financial losses. 
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the function is carefully tested and validated to 
avoid any precision loss.

## Tool used
VS Code
Manual Review

## Recommendation
You could refactor the code to the below:
```solidity
  uint256 decreasingFactor = timeSinceLiquidable >= loan.auction.duration
            ? 0
            : uint256(10**18).sub(timeSinceLiquidable.mul(uint256(10**18)).div(loan.auction.duration));

        // The estimated value arises from the mean of the loan offer loanToValues used in the loan regarding their
        // share in the collateral usage. This must stay consistent even if less than the full value of the NFT has been
        // used as collateral
        uint256 estimatedValue = loan.lent.mul(uint256(10**18)).div(loan.shareLent);

        // By multiplying the estimated price by some factor and slowly decreasing this price over time we aim to
        // make sure a liquidator will buy the NFT at fair market price.
        return estimatedValue.mul(loan.auction.priceFactor).mul(decreasingFactor).div(uint256(10**18));
    }
```
