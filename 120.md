# Borrowers can DoS lenders

## Summary

By looping borrows and repays, a malicious borrower can deny a lender of all protocol functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Kairos protocol is unique in that lenders do not transfer funds to the protocol. Instead their lent value is managed by an approval. However a borrower can loop borrows and repays to exhaust a lender's approval while paying little, or even zero, interest. Once the lender's approval is exhausted, no more borrowers may use that lender's offer until the lender tops up their approval.

If the protocol has not set a minimum interest value for the specific lent currency being used, then this attack is free.
