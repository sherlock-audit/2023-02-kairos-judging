# ClaimFacet#claim burns the positionId NFT before updating the state

## Summary

ClaimFacet#claim burns the positionId NFT before updating the state, which results in null values.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a lender wants the claim their fair share from liquidation, he calls ClaimFacet#claim. The function then checks the positionId (that was minted during the borrowing phase) and checks their claim amount. However, the function burns the NFT before updating the state of the storage, which results in null values.

```solidity
    function claim(uint256[] calldata positionIds) external returns (uint256 sent) {
        Protocol storage proto = protocolStorage();
        SupplyPosition storage sp = supplyPositionStorage();
        Loan storage loan;
        Provision storage provision;
        uint256 loanId;
        uint256 sentTemp;


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < positionIds.length; i++) {
            if (!_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, positionIds[i])) {
                revert ERC721CallerIsNotOwnerNorApproved();
            }
///@--audit burn before update
            _burn(positionIds[i]);
            provision = sp.provision[positionIds[i]];
            loanId = provision.loanId;
            loan = proto.loan[loanId];
```

Since there is no more positionIds[i], any variable pointing to positionIds[i] will point towards a null value. 

## Impact

ClaimFacet#claim burns the positionId NFT before updating the state, which results in null values.

## Recommendation

Call burn later, after supply position and protocol storage is updated.
