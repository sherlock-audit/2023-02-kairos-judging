# checkedTransferFrom is invalid for USDT

## Summary

`checkedTransferFrom` is invalid for USDT, if the lender provides USDT as asset to lend, the loan will not be issued.

## Vulnerability Detail

`checkedTransferFrom` code is as follows.
https://github.com/kairos-loan/kairos-contracts/blob/b2fd98d62cf0f25ee1db2bd551cd7b4606a5a988/src/utils/Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol#L9
```solidity
function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, from, to);
        }
    }
```

This code checks the bool value returned by `transferFrom`, but non-standard ERC20 tokens like USDT do not return a bool value for `transferFrom`, so this code will revert.

USDT:
```solidity
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) public whenNotPaused {
        require(!isBlackListed[_from]);
        if (deprecated) {
            return UpgradedStandardToken(upgradedAddress).transferFromByLegacy(msg.sender, _from, _to, _value);
        } else {
            return super.transferFrom(_from, _to, _value);
        }
    }
```

## Impact

If the lender provides USDT as asset to lend, the loan will not be issued.
