# Unchecked `tranche` number input while signing offer could lead to bad user experience

## Summary

Mistake inputting `tranche` value while providing loan supply and signed it, could lead to the loan offer unexpectedly borrowed with unintended interest rate.

## Vulnerability Detail

Supplier typically create loan offer via `offerDigest` method taking an `Offer` struct as argument and returning a bytes32 hash then signed it. If supplier input `tranche` incorrectly and signed it, the offer is available but no borrower can take the loan since checking the number of tranches allows us to deduce if the tranche id is valid or not.

 But suppose after offer is signed, and admin add `trance` which match with the incorrectly `tranche` inputted  in the previous offer, the loan offer can now be borrowed but with unexpected interest rate for the loan supplier.

## PoC

1. At the time supplier create offer, the only available` proto.tranche` is the index 0 with value :
```solidity
proto.tranche[0] = ONE.div(10).mul(4).div(365 days); // 40% APR
```
2. user mistakenly add 1 as `offer.tranche` value when creating offer.

3. No one can able to take the loan, which is expected.

4. Admin add value for `proto.tranche[1]`, while the offer is not yet expired, which may not be desired by the supplier.

5. Now the borrower can take the loan since it will pass the check inside `BorrowCheckers`'s `checkOfferArg`

```solidity
        if (arg.offer.tranche >= proto.nbOfTranches) {
            revert InvalidTranche(proto.nbOfTranches);
        }
```

## Impact

User exposed to unexpected risk, loan can be borrowed but with unexpected interest rate.

There is no input check inside `offerDigest` and `typeHashOffer` for the `offer.tranche` value.

```solidity
    function offerDigest(Offer memory offer) public view returns (bytes32) {
        return _hashTypedDataV4(typeHashOffer(offer));
    }
```

```solidity
    function typeHashOffer(Offer memory offer) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        return
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    OFFER_TYPEHASH,
                    offer.assetToLend,
                    offer.loanToValue,
                    offer.duration,
                    offer.expirationDate,
                    offer.tranche,
                    typeHashNFToken(offer.collateral)
                )
            );
    }
```

`tranche` check will pass if `arg.offer.tranche` is defined, even previously not exist when the offer is signed.

```solidity
        if (arg.offer.tranche >= proto.nbOfTranches) {
            revert InvalidTranche(proto.nbOfTranches);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider to also add `offer.tranche` input check inside `offerDigest` function.

```solidity
    function offerDigest(Offer memory offer) public view returns (bytes32) {
        if (offer.tranche >= proto.nbOfTranches) {
            revert InvalidTranche(proto.nbOfTranches);
        }
        return _hashTypedDataV4(typeHashOffer(offer));
    }
```
