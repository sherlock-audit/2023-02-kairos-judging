# Lenders can add conditional logic inside safeMint callback to decide if they should lend or not

## Summary
Lenders can add conditional logic inside safeMint callback to decide if they should lend or not

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the Kairos Documentation, they expect that lenders can cancel their loan offers by removing approvals. 
However, they can also achieve this by adding a revert inside the hook of the safe mint of supply nft. 

Additionally, lenders can include conditional logic to determine whether or not they want to lend based on some specific state. For example, they may choose to lend only if the borrower is a specific address or if the borrowed amount is below a certain maximum limit. 
It is unclear whether this behavior is intended or not. 
If it is intended, then there is no problem. 
However, if it is not intended, it may be worth resolving this issue.

## Impact
**Borrowers may keep wasting gas since they have no visibility of lenders' specific requirements.**

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
As I said, I am not sure if this is intended or not only.
If yes, feel free to discard this issue and consider adding this as viable option in documentation.
If not, consider using mint in place of safe mint
IMO using callbacks increases attack surfaces more in comparison to its value add
