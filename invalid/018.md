# Lenders will generally receive less money from auctions as they use Dutch Auction logic

## Summary
An item's real value is the most someone is willing to pay for it. When selling something, (especially on someone else's behalf, in this scenario - the lender's) it should the project's goal to sell it for as much as possible. Using Dutch Auction over English Auction system will generally result in the item selling for less.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario: 
An NFT auction is about to begin. The 2 bidders are Alice and Bob. Alice is willing to pay up to 500 USDC for it and Bob is willing to pay up to 600 USDC for it. 

What would happen using Dutch Auction:
 > Let's say price starts at 1000 USDC.
 > As soon as price gets down to 600 USDC, Bob is willing to purchase the NFT. In order to make sure he gets it for as low as possible, he starts monitoring the mempool to see if anyone (in this case Alice) is interested in buying it too. In case Alice decides to buy the NFT, Bob will see the tx in the mempool and will front-run it.
 > Price gets down to 500 USDC. Alice decides that's low enough and tries to purchase it. Bob sees the tx and front-runs it. Bob now owns the NFT
 > Furthermore, if Alice is greedy and tries and waits for the price to drop even more, the NFT will be sold for even less and once again Bob will get it.
 > End result: Bob purchases the NFT for <=500 USDC

What would happen using English Auction: 
 > Price would start low (e.g 100 USDC)
 > Alice and Bob will be bidding against each other up until Alice puts up a bid for the most she is willing to pay - 500 USDC
 > Since Bob is willing to pay more, he bids for 500 + minimumOutbidAmount* .
 > End result: Bob purchases the NFT for >500 USDC (500 + minimumOutbidAmount* , where minimumOutbidAmount is the lowest amount by which user A's bid should be bigger than user B's bid in order for the bid to be considered valid) 


## Impact
By using Dutch Auction the lenders will get significantly less than what's the NFT's real value. Switching to English Auction would guarantee them more money. This would also incentivize more people to be lenders.
