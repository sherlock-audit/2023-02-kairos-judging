# If users mint a NFT to the protocol directly for borrowing, the NFT and borrowed amount will be lost because the operator is `address(0)`.

## Summary

If users mint a NFT to the protocol directly for borrowing, the NFT and borrowed amount will be lost because the operator is `address(0)`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The comment of `BorrowFacet.onERC721Received()` function:
> @notice borrow using sent NFT as collateral without needing approval through transfer callback

Someone could send NFT as collateral by transferring NFT to the protocol directly.
But if someone tries to mint NFT as collateral to the protocol, the NFT and borrowed amount will be stuck because the `operator` of `safeMint` is `address(0)`.

```solidity
    function _safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
        _mint(to, tokenId);
        require(
            _checkOnERC721Received(address(0), to, tokenId, data),
            "ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer"
        );
    }
```

## Impact

The NFT and borrowed amount will be lost because the operator is `address(0)`.

## Recommendation

Check `operator != address(0)` in BorrowFacet.onERC721Received().
