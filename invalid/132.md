# User may lost  all offer money due to token with fees

## Summary

If provide Offer in ERC20 token with fee, after repay, User(Offer owner) lost money. He may lost a significant amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's consider two cases:
The first one:

1) User uses ERC20 token with fee (let's for clarity assumes that fee is 5%) to provide `Offer`.
2) Borrower uses these Offer and use whole offer's amount (i.e. `shares = ONE`).
2.1) NFT costs 100$, borrower receives 95$, But on the Kairo in user's storage (`Provision`  struct) in `amount` position wrote 100$.
3) Borrower repaid loan at the same transaction and paid `100+minInterestsToRepay`.
3.1) Contract's balance now `95+minInterestsToRepay`.
4) User claims tokens.
4.1) The contract owed to user: `sent = provision.amount + (interests / loan.nbOfPositions)`.  I.e. `100+minInterestsToRepay` (because  has been used only one Offer).
5) User calls `claim` function from `ClaimFacet`. 
5.1) The contract will be paid  `100+minInterestsToRepay`, BUT contract has `95+minInterestsToRepay`.
5.2) Transaction will be failed during `sendInterests` function in line 105. `loan.assetLent.checkedTransfer(msg.sender, sent);`.

Possible recovery path:
User must send lacking fees to the contract. But this is a bad way, because transaction might be front-running by another unlucky user(Offer owner), who does not require a commission to receive money.

The second one Vulnerability case, really bad case:

1) ERC20 token with fee = 5%
2) NFT token costs 1000$.
3) All offers propose 1000$.
4) Borrower uses 10 offers and takes 10% per offer. I.e. each from each offer has been taken 100$.
5) Loan has been filled in auction with price 1000$.
5.1) In fact, the contract will receive 950$. (Due to 5% fees).
6) Users starts to withdraw their funds:
6.1) User 1 withdraws his loan -- 100$. The contract balance 850$
6.2) User 2 withdraws his loan -- 100$. The contract balance 750$
6.3) ... User 9 withdraws his loan -- 100$. The contract balance 50$ 
6.4) User 10 can't withdraw his loan -- 100. Because the contract has not enough amount (50$).

## Impact

* User's funds might be stuck on the contract after borrower paid for loan, and to extract there funds user(Offer owner) must transfer a bit of amount to the Kairos contract (to cover fees).  But of course this is not good solution due to front-run possibility.
* The user's harm might be different, it depends on amount of offers used in the borrowing.  And it can be really significant, like in case 2.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When transfer ERC20 tokens from Borrower to contact (when Repay or Auction stages) write actual received amounts with follow code:
```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = loan.assetLent.balanceOf(address(this));
// todo DONT FORGET ABOUT REENTRANCY! ADD REENTRANCY GUARD
loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), money);  
uint256 balanceAfter = loan.assetLent.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
loan.payment.paid = amount;
```

Or revert if amount not enought:
```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = loan.assetLent.balanceOf(address(this));
// todo DONT FORGET ABOUT REENTRANCY! ADD REENTRANCY GUARD
loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), money);  
uint256 balanceAfter = loan.assetLent.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
require(toRepay <= amount, "not enought funds paid");
loan.payment.paid = amount;
```
