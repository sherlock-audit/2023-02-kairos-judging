# It's possible to reuse Offer twice

## Summary

It's possible to use `Offer` till `expirationDate`, which might lead to possibility to get loan on scammed collection, when this collection costs nothing.


## Vulnerability Detail

Let's consider next case:

1) Attacker creates collection, he advertises it on Twitter, promises interesting rewards, and tokens in a couple of years.
2) Users find this interesting and become to buy this collection. Therefore, collection's price increases.
3) Users start to borrow this NFT on the Kairos, and permits to use their money in `Offer` structure. 
4) At one day attacker delete his Twitter, extracts money from all accounts and run away.
5) From this time in 99% cases NFT costs nothing, the price dropping fast .
6) Users who bought NFT don't want to lose theirs money, and they can borrow money from still valid `Offers`, and not repay them. It's possible because  the offers are valid (not expired), and these offers suggest money at better prices, while the collection costs nothing. 
7) User who `Offer` money may lost their funds.

## Impact

User's funds might be reused more than once, or any time till expiration
this might lead to possibility to steal offer's funds before the collapse of collection. Because when data with sign becomes public anyone can use it.

## Code Snippet

Let's consider `BorrowChecker.sol` and function `checkOfferArg`:
```solidity
    function checkOfferArg(OfferArg memory arg) internal view returns (address signer) {
        Protocol storage proto = protocolStorage();
        signer = ECDSA.recover(offerDigest(arg.offer), arg.signature);
        uint256 amountLowerBound = proto.offerBorrowAmountLowerBound[arg.offer.assetToLend];
        if (!(arg.amount > amountLowerBound)) {
            revert RequestedAmountIsUnderMinimum(arg.offer, arg.amount, amountLowerBound);
        }
        if (block.timestamp > arg.offer.expirationDate) {
            revert OfferHasExpired(arg.offer, arg.offer.expirationDate);
        }
        if (arg.offer.tranche >= proto.nbOfTranches) {
            revert InvalidTranche(proto.nbOfTranches);
        }
    }
```

Here we checks sign, and fields like `tranche`, `expirationDate`, but this don't give us uniques of `Offers`, and we might reuse this `OfferArg` once again till validation.

In `Object.sol` see at structures:
```solidity
struct OfferArg {
    bytes signature;
    uint256 amount;
    Offer offer;
}

struct Offer {
    IERC20 assetToLend;
    uint256 loanToValue;
    uint256 duration;
    uint256 expirationDate;
    uint256 tranche;
    NFToken collateral;
}
```

Yes, we have `expirationDate`, but it's not enough, because while `expirationDate` valid we can reuse this `Offer` again and again.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

* Add nonce to NFT collection at all, and NFT's id's separately. 
* Add possibility to user to set minimum valid nonce manually.


User(Offer owner) should have possibility to set minimum valid nonce. And during borrowing stage, the contract must validate this nonce, and if nonce is outdated then revert. 

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) nftNonce; // nonce per whole NFT collection.
mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) nftIdNoce; // nonce per NFT's ids. 
```

In `BorrowCheckers` improve current implementation like this:
```solidity
function checkOfferArg(OfferArg memory arg) internal view returns (address signer) {
      ...
      tokenNonce = nftIdNonce[colection][signer][id];
      nftNonce = nftNonce[colection][id];
      if(arg.nonce <= tokenNonce || arg.nonoce <= nftNonce) {
      revert();
      }  
      // update nonces
      ...
}
```

Additionally see how it's implemented in Uniswap V2:
https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2ERC20.sol#L87
function permit. Pay attention to: ```nonces[owner]++```
