# Uncapped gains to lenders on collateral liquidation can incentivise them to front-run borrower repayments to force liquidations

## Summary
All CDP protocols are designed in a way where lenders want borrowers to repay on time rather than default. Purpose of collateral posted by borrowers is to ensure lenders are protected in the event of default - purpose is NOT for lenders to make gains on collateral at the expense of borrower.

Current system design gives lenders a share in collateral whose upside is uncapped. If price of NFT collateral sees a huge rise, lender's share of NFT collateral could be worth much more than their principal + interest receivable.

This creates a perverse incentive for lenders to front-run genuine borrowers who are trying to repay full amount once loan period ends. Front-running liquidations can create windfall gains to lenders & cause potentially huge losses to borrowers who stand to lose their expensive collateral (see example below)

## Vulnerability Detail
There are 2 scenarios possible at loan end date.

`Scenario 1` - borrower pays back the full interest + principal due on loan amount on/before loan end date. In this case, [`sendInterests` in ClaimsFacet](https://github.com/kairos-loan/kairos-contracts/blob/b2fd98d62cf0f25ee1db2bd551cd7b4606a5a988/src/ClaimFacet.sol#L105) ensures that lenders are paid out their share of the borrower repayment

`Scenario 2` - borrower does not pay. In this case, auction liquidates the NFT collateral. [`sendShareOfSaleAsSupplier` in ClaimsFacet](https://github.com/kairos-loan/kairos-contracts/blob/b2fd98d62cf0f25ee1db2bd551cd7b4606a5a988/src/ClaimFacet.sol#L118) ensures lenders are paid out their share of NFT liquidation value. Note that there is no cap on this value. This opens a possibility that lender's share of NFT collateral can be much greater than the interest + principal value they would have received in `Scenario 1`

Consider following example scenario

- Bob has a fictitious BAYC NFT priced at 2 ETH (actual price as on 30 Jun 21)
- Alex & Alice make 2 offers to Bob, Alex offers LTV 2 ETH with 40% APY and 6 month duration. Alice offers LTV of 1 ETH with 40% APY and 6 month duration
- Bob uses 1 ETH from Alex's offer (share = 50%) and 0.5 ETH from Alice's offer (share = 50%). `shareLent` in Loan created is 100% (Alex (50%) + Alice(50%))
- 6 months pass & assume we are on the repayment date (30 Dec 21). Price of BayC NFT rises to 60 ETH (actual price as on 30 Dec 21)
- If Bob pays back interest on repayment date, Alex and Alice would receive total of 1.2 ETH and 0.6 ETH respectively. Bob gets back his BAYC NFT
- However, if Bob cannot pay for whatever reason, Alex and Alice get 30 ETH each (50%*60 ETH -assuming liquidation happens at market price on that day)
- If Bob is trying to repay on/after loan end, Alice & Alex will have all the incentive to front-run Bob's repayment transaction and liquidate the NFT

## Impact
In above example, Bob stands to lose 60 ETH worth collateral for just 1.5 ETH worth borrowing.

Purpose of collateral is to protect lenders but current design is making collateral a profit making opportunity for lenders. A system where lenders pray for borrower default cannot be a stable CDP system - borrowers will bear huge loses when collateral rises in value and will lose trust in the protocol

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider capping the max lender receivable incase of liquidation to the principal + interest due to that lender. And transfer the excess value back to the borrower after deducting for liquidation fees.

`sendShareOfSaleAsSupplier` should calculate sent as follows

`sent = min(liquidation * lender share,  (liquidation - total loan) * provision / total loan)`

This will fairly align everyone's interests & prevent borrower losses caused by lenders trying to front-run collateral liquidation.
