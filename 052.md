# Should Not Mark with totalSupply()

## Summary
Should Not Mark with totalSupply()
## Vulnerability Detail
In `BorrowHandlers::useCollateral`, the value of `firstSupplyPositionId` is generated using `supplyPositionStorage().totalSupply + 1`.

```solidity
function useCollateral(
      OfferArg[] memory args,
      address from,
      NFToken memory nft
  ) internal returns (Loan memory loan) {
      CollateralState memory collatState = initializedCollateralState(args[0], from, nft);

      // total supply is later incremented as part of the minting of the first supply position
      uint256 firstSupplyPositionId = supplyPositionStorage().totalSupply + 1;
```
However, there is a problem here, when the asset corresponding to `supplyPositionStorage` is destroyed, the value of `totalSupply()` will decrease, so that when the `useCollateral function()` is called again, `firstSupplyPositionId` will be the same as before.
