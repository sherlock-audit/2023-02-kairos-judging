# ERC20's that behave different with returning a boolean can get tokens stuck in the contract

## Summary
Because of the way the contract verifies if the transfer was successful or not in the `Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol` lenders can get their coins stuck in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are ERC20 tokens that have different behaviors than what it is expected, for example there are tokens that don't return any boolean at all on `transfer` or `transferFrom`, or there are tokens that return a boolean on one of the two functions. One big example of this type of ERC20 is BNB. BNB is a token which returns a boolean on `transferFrom` but doesn't return anything on transfer so the vulnerability will look like this : 
   1. lender will create an Offer with the `assetToLend` being BNB;
   2. borrower will borrow the amount of tokens using their NFT as the collateral, the funds gets transferred from the lender to the borrower getting trough the `checkedTransferFrom` function, which doesn't revert because it returns a boolean
   3. the borrower repays the loan and the interest transferring the assets from his account to the contract account which call again `checkedTransferFrom` and since it return a boolean it will not revert, if it is sucessfull
  4. lender will have to call the `claim` function to get his assets and the interest that he got from lending his assets, calling the `checkedTransfer` to transfer the tokens from the contract to the lender
   5. `checkedTransfer` will always revert because BNB is an ERC20 token that doesn't return a boolean on simple `transfer` as you can see in the image below

The tokens will get stuck in the contract and there is no way to take the tokens out, which will make the lender loosing his assets.

## Impact
The severity of this issue is a High Severity since it can make the user loosing his assets and multiple ERC20 that have weird behavior can get the contract into this state

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommendation would be using the `safeTransferFrom` and `safeTransfer` wrappers from OpenZeppelin instead of using `transfer` and `transferFrom` since it solves the problems of tokens that don't return any boolean on these function. Also that would help the protocol to work with multiple ERC20 that don't return a boolean, like USDT, which is the biggest stable coin in the space that doesn't return a boolean on `transferFrom` or `transfer`.
