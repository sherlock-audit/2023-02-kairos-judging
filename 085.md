# ERC20's that don't let transfer of 0 amount of tokens can get the NFT stuck in the contract in case of liquidation

## Summary
If the asset that was lent to a borrower is an ERC20 token that doesn't let the transfer of 0 tokens, the NFT can get stuck in the contract if the borrower was liquidated
## Vulnerability Detail
In case of liquidation the NFT would go in a Dutch auction, where the price is starting high and is decreasing as time passes until it reaches 0 and remain 0. In the case where the `decreasingFactor` gets to 0 anyone can claim the NFT for free (*as it is stated in the kairos book*), but if the asset lent is an ERC20 token that doesn't allow the transfer of 0 tokens( *BNB as an example of high market cap token*), nobody can claim the NFT and it will get stuck in the contract because the contract doesn't take into account the case where `toPay` is 0 and just transfers the tokens.
## Impact
This issue is a Medium Severity because the liquidated assets can get stuck in the contract forever

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A simple solution would be to take into account the case of `toPay` is equal to 0 and transfer the NFT as it is, an example is in the snippet below:
```solidity
uint256 toPay = price(arg.loanId);
if (toPay == 0){
   loan.payment.liquidated = true;
   loan.payment.paid = toPay;
   loan.collateral.implem.safeTransferFrom(address(this), arg.to, loan.collateral.id);
} else {
   loan.payment.liquidated = true;
   loan.payment.paid = toPay;
   loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toPay);
   loan.collateral.implem.safeTransferFrom(address(this), arg.to, loan.collateral.id);
}
```
