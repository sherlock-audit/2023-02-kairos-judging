# No support for feeOnTransfer tokens

## Summary
The BorrowHandlers.sol do not support fee-on-transfer tokens, preventing suppliers from claiming loan amount + interests
## Vulnerability detail
The BorrowHandlers.sol do not support fee-on-transfer tokens. In function ```useOffer()``` protocol assumes that amount specified in transfer equals the amount received. And this amount bigger than actual is borrowed and written in Loan structure. Then in RepayFacet.sol and AuctionFacet.sol protocol receives less than it suggests. And finally in ClaimFacet.sol protocol has less amount than the amount transferred back to supplier (loan amount + interests). Resulting in error when insufficient balance - it prevents owner of last SupplyPosition on this token from claiming loan amount + interests.

#### Example
tokenX has 10% fee on transfer.
1) User1 signs Offer with amount == 1000.
2) User2 borrows from this offer. Receives 1000 - (1000 * 10%) = 900. Protocol mints Supply position to User1 with amount = 1000
```solidity
        // transferring the borrowed funds from the lender to the borrower
        collatState.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(signer, collatState.from, arg.amount);

        // issuing supply position NFT to the signer of the loan offer with metadatas
        safeMint(signer, Provision({amount: arg.amount, share: shareMatched, loanId: collatState.loanId}));
```
and saves lentAmount = 1000 in Loan structure
```solidity
loan = initializedLoan(collatState, from, nft, nbOfOffers, lent, firstSupplyPositionId);
```
3) Say user2 must repay 200 tokens in interests for easy calculations. User repays 1000 + 200 = 1200 to protocol. Protocol receives 1200 - (1200 * 10%) = 1080 and sets toRepay = 1200. Remember that actual amount in protocol is 1080 tokens.
```solidity
toRepay = lent + interests;
loan.payment.paid = toRepay;
loan.payment.borrowerClaimed = true;loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toRepay);
loan.collateral.implem.safeTransferFrom(address(this), loan.borrower, loan.collateral.id);
```
4) Finally user1 wants to claim this repayed loan. 
```solidity
provision = sp.provision[positionIds[i]];
            loanId = provision.loanId;
            loan = proto.loan[loanId];

            if (loan.payment.liquidated) {
                sentTemp = sendShareOfSaleAsSupplier(loan, provision);
            } else {
                if (loan.payment.paid == 0) {
                    revert LoanNotRepaidOrLiquidatedYet(loanId);
                }
                sentTemp = sendInterests(loan, provision);
            }
```
```solidity
 /// @notice sends principal plus interests of the loan to `msg.sender`
 /// @param loan - to calculate amount from
 /// @param provision liquidity provision for this loan
 /// @return sent amount sent
 function sendInterests(Loan storage loan, Provision storage provision) internal returns (uint256 sent) {
        uint256 interests = loan.payment.paid - loan.lent;
        if (interests == loan.payment.minInterestsToRepay) {
            // this is the case if the loan is repaid shortly after issuance
            // each lender gets its minimal interest, as an anti ddos measure to spam offer
            sent = provision.amount + (interests / loan.nbOfPositions);
        } else {
            /* provision.amount / lent = share of the interests belonging to the lender. The parenthesis make the
            calculus in the order that maximizes precison */
            sent = provision.amount + (interests * (provision.amount)) / loan.lent;
        }
        loan.assetLent.checkedTransfer(msg.sender, sent);
 }
```
Amount in provision is 1000 + interests (we took 200 for example)
Code reverts on transfer line due to insufficient balance.

## Recommendation
Use balanceBefore and balanceAfter instead of amount on all transfers: In AuctionFacet.sol, BorrowHandlers.sol, RepayFacet.sol
```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = collatState.assetLent.balanceOf(address(this));
collatState.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(signer, collatState.from, arg.amount);
uint256 balanceAfter= collatState.assetLent.balanceOf(address(this));

// issuing supply position NFT to the signer of the loan offer with metadatas
safeMint(signer, Provision({amount: balanceAfter - balanceBefore, share: shareMatched, loanId: collatState.loanId}));
```
