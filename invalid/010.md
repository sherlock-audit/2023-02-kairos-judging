# Block timestamp dependence for checking offer expiry

## Summary
Block timestamp dependence

## Vulnerability Detail

SWC-116 - Block values as a proxy for time

## Impact

## Code Snippet
[Reference](https://github.com/kairos-loan/kairos-contracts/blob/b2fd98d62cf0f25ee1db2bd551cd7b4606a5a988/src/BorrowLogic/BorrowCheckers.sol#L42)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Developers should write smart contracts with the notion that block values are not precise, and the use of them can lead to unexpected effects. Alternatively, they may make use oracles.
