# The protocol could be re-initialized by anone by calling Initializer#init()

## Summary
The protocol could be re-initialized by anone by calling `Initializer#init()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Initializer#init()` function is external and performs no checks on the caller. Anyone could call it and re-initialize the protocol.

## Impact
`proto.nbOfTranches` could be set to `1` which would be undesirable since `proto.nbOfTranches` is incremented in `AdminFacet` upon new tranche creation. The incremented `newTrancheId` is used as an index in the `proto.tranches` array of tranches. This effectively means that a malicious user could overwrite already existing tranches by re-initializing the contract (and setting `proto.nbOfTranches` to `1`).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure that the `Initializer#init()` function is only called by the protocol owner.
