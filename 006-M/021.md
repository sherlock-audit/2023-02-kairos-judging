# Protocol doesn't support tokens with missing return values

## Summary
When transferring assets (to borrow, repay or claim a loan) the library `Erc20CheckedTransfer` is used which reverts when transfers do not return `true`. This means the protocol does not support the use of tokens such as `USDT` or `BNB` which do not return a value.

## Vulnerability Detail
Any attempt to transfer funds, including making a loan, repaying it, buying a collateral NFT in an auction or claiming assets, will use the following functions to transfer `ERC20` tokens:
```solidity
library Erc20CheckedTransfer {
    function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, from, to);
        }
    }

    function checkedTransfer(IERC20 currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!currency.transfer(to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, address(this), to);
        }
    }
}
```
Those functions always revert if the currency used doesn't return `true` on successful transfers. [This is the case for several tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#missing-return-values). Due to the failure when attempting to borrow assets using a loan offer with such a token, no user assets (including NFTs) are actually at risk and yet I believe this bug is quite meaningful because this is a core function of the protocol.

## Impact
Tokens with missing return values are not supported.

## Recommendation
Consider using OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library instead of `Erc20CheckedTransfer`.
