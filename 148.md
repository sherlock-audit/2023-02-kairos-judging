# Unsafe ERC20.transferFrom()

## Summary

The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Vulnerability Detail

Using unsafe ERC20 methods can revert the transaction for certain tokens.

## Impact

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowFacet.sol#L40

```solidity
function borrow(BorrowArg[] calldata args) external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
            args[i].nft.implem.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), args[i].nft.id); 
            useCollateral(args[i].args, msg.sender, args[i].nft);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
