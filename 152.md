# Invalid loanID passed in to function resulting in a user losing funds on transaction

## Summary
Invalid loanID passed in to function resulting in a user losing funds on transaction


## Vulnerability Detail
If a user passes in an invalid loanID to the price function, the function will revert, 
and the user will lose any funds associated with the transaction that they sent to the contract.


## Impact
Loss of transaction funds upon execution.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/AuctionFacet.sol#L34

## Tool used
```solidity
function testPaidPriceShouldBeTheSameAsReturnedByPriceMethod() public {
    uint256[] memory loanIds = new uint256[](3);
    loanIds[0] = 1;
    loanIds[1] = 2;
    loanIds[2] = 3;
    getFlooz(signer, money);
    nft.mintOneTo(address(kairos));
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < loanIds.length; i++) {
        require(nft.ownerOf(loanIds[i]) == address(kairos), "NFT is not owned by contract");
        BuyArg[] memory args = new BuyArg[](1);
        args[0] = setupLoan(loanIds[i])[0];
        uint256 balanceBefore = money.balanceOf(signer);
        skip(3600);
        uint256 price = kairos.price(loanIds[i]);
        vm.prank(signer);
        kairos.buy(args);
        assertEq(balanceBefore - money.balanceOf(signer), price);
    }
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Mitigation:
```solidity
function price(uint256 loanId) public view returns (uint256) {
    require(protocolStorage().loan[loanId].status != LoanStatus.Nonexistent, "Invalid loan ID");
    // rest of the function code
}
```

This will check if the loan ID provided by the user exists in the protocolStorage().loan mapping,
and revert the transaction if it does not. This would prevent users from losing funds on a 
failed transaction due to an invalid loan ID.
