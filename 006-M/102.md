# checkedTransfer In claim() and claimAsBorrower() Functions Can Permanently Lock Tokens

## Summary
Certain ERC20 tokens like BNB return bools oddly. USDT doesn't return bools at all but I believe you guys are aware of that and it's not as big of a problem because it can't be used in the first place. BNB, however, returns a bool so that checkedTransferFrom will succeed, but does not return one on transfer. This results in a situation where a loan can happen, liquidation or repayment can occur, but the lender will then have their funds permanently stuck in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The BNB transferFrom function returns (bool). That means the checkedTransferFrom will succeed and loans can be initiated. The transfer function, however, does not return one and no funds can be claimed.

## Impact
Results in permanently stuck funds so I would rate this as a high. It would be lower if the token couldn't be used in the first place, such as USDT, but an unsuspecting user can have their funds stuck.

## Code Snippet
checkedTransferFrom requiring true return:

Code from the BNB token:
```solidity
/* Send coins */
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) {
        if (_to == 0x0) throw;                               // Prevent transfer to 0x0 address. Use burn() instead
		if (_value <= 0) throw; 
        if (balanceOf[msg.sender] < _value) throw;           // Check if the sender has enough
        if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) throw; // Check for overflows
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = SafeMath.safeSub(balanceOf[msg.sender], _value);                     // Subtract from the sender
        balanceOf[_to] = SafeMath.safeAdd(balanceOf[_to], _value);                            // Add the same to the recipient
        Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);                   // Notify anyone listening that this transfer took place
    }

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
        if (_to == 0x0) throw;                                // Prevent transfer to 0x0 address. Use burn() instead
		if (_value <= 0) throw; 
        if (balanceOf[_from] < _value) throw;                 // Check if the sender has enough
        if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) throw;  // Check for overflows
        if (_value > allowance[_from][msg.sender]) throw;     // Check allowance
        balanceOf[_from] = SafeMath.safeSub(balanceOf[_from], _value);                           // Subtract from the sender
        balanceOf[_to] = SafeMath.safeAdd(balanceOf[_to], _value);                             // Add the same to the recipient
        allowance[_from][msg.sender] = SafeMath.safeSub(allowance[_from][msg.sender], _value);
        Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either use safeTransfer instead of checkedTransfer or add an allowlist for tokens that does not include flawed ones.
