# Token with fees will break claim() funtions

## Summary

ERC20 with fees tokens used as loan `assetLent` will break protocol claim() functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

If ERC20 with fees is used, when borrower want to repay his loan using `repay()` function inside `RepayFaucet` or when someone liquidate and call `buy()` from `AuctionFaucet`, `loan.payment.paid` is updated using the calculated amount, rather than the actual received token. This will cause the `loan.payment.paid` value is higher than the actual received token.

## Impact

This can cause lenders (or borrowers in some case) fail to call `claim()` and receive his reward because of the difference between `loan.payment.paid` and actual protocol balance. Loss of users funds caused by stuck are possible.

## PoC

Let's imagine lender setup `assetLent` with ERC20 that have fee 1%.

after borrower loan, and repay his debt 100 token, the protocol only received 99.

```solidity
loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toRepay);
```

but the recorded repay payment is 100

```solidity
loan.payment.paid = toRepay;
```

or in liquidate case, when someone buy NFT from auction, with price calculated for example 100

the buyer will put 100 token, the protocol receive 99.

```solidity
loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toPay);
```

but the recorded NFT buy payment is 100

```solidity
loan.payment.paid = toPay;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To avoid problems, use common pattern, when you check your balance before operation and balance after :

```solidity
        uint256 toPay = price(arg.loanId);
        loan.payment.liquidated = true;
        uint256 balanceBefore = loan.assetLent.balanceOf(address(this));
        loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toPay);
        uint256 balanceAfter = loan.assetLent.balanceOf(address(this));

        uint256 tokenAmount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        
        loan.payment.paid = tokenAmount;
        

```
