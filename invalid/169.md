# borrow() function have unbounded loop leads to dos of gas.limit

## Summary
borrow() function have unbounded loop leads to dos of gas.limit

## Vulnerability Detail
When user try to borrow  loan with  large amount  of NFT's  then in borrow() function there is [loop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/BorrowFacet.sol#L41) where calls each NFT's [OfferAgrs[] args](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/DataStructure/Objects.sol#L25) array from stroage when user try submit large of array which leads to dos of block.gas limit.

## Impact
Dos of gas limit in borrow() loop

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Use a different data structure for the [OfferArg[] args](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/DataStructure/Objects.sol#L25), such as an [EnumerableMap](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/b7aff6363f3f8c4505d77d337b3e1262464025f1/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableMap.sol), to reduce code maintenance overhead and ensure necessary operations can be performed in constant gas
- Set limit to number of borrowing in one transaction .
