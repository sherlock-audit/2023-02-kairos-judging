# The function claim will revert if the NFT was sold for 0

## Summary
The function claim allows a supplier to claim principal plus interests or liquidation share due as a supplier. It checks whether the liquidation amount paid is 0.This is done as a check to see whether the loan has been repaid or liquidated yet. However, a loan can be liquidated for free if no one buys the collateral at auction. If such a situation arises, the function claim will revert

## Vulnerability Detail
Here the function claim checks whether the liquidated amount paid is great than 0.

This is done to check whether a loan has been repaid or liquidated. However, a loan can be liquidated without paying anything, because the auction is a dutch auction. So if no one submits a bid, the liquidation value of the loan can be reduced to 0.
