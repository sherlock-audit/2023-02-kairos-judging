# NFT can be stuck if transferred using transferFrom instead of safeTransferFrom.

## Summary

The `onERC721Received` callback is only called on safe functions which call the function `_checkOnERC721Received` that later on calls `onERC721Received` . These callbacks are missing on transferFrom functions. If a user transfers using transferFrom instead of safeTransferFrom functions, the callback wonâ€™t be executed and the NFT would be stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail

This function is only executed on safeTransferFrom function:

```solidity
function onERC721Received(
        address operator,
        address, // from
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4) {
        OfferArg[] memory args = abi.decode(data, (OfferArg[]));

        // `operator` will be considered the borrower, enabling integration contracts to fully manage loans,
        // similarly how an approved contract can take a loan on behalf of the nft owner with the `borrow` method
        useCollateral(args, operator, NFToken({implem: IERC721(msg.sender), id: tokenId}));

        return this.onERC721Received.selector;
    }
```

The NFT might be stuck if it is transferred using transferFrom.

## Impact

NFT would be stuck in the contract and user would loose it. There is no emergency withdrawal which would permanently stuck the NFT. As this is a very likely scenario that a user transfers using transferFrom, it can be considered as high severity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Creating an emergency withdrawal function only called from the owner can solve the issue. Or explicitly mention in the docs that the do not transfer using transferFrom.
