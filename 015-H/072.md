# `ClaimFacet.sendShareOfSaleAsSupplier()` calculates unfair shares, the money should compensate lenders first.

## Summary

`ClaimFacet.sendShareOfSaleAsSupplier()` calculates unfair shares, the money should compensate lenders first.

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose a NFT token values 200 USDC, and Eve calls `borrow`.
* loanToValue of Alice's loan is 100 USDC, Eve borrows 10 USDC, provision.share: 10%
* loanToValue of Bob's loan is 200 USDC, Eve borrows 10 USDC, provision.share: 5%

Someone liquidates, if the paid amount is less than `loan.lent`, for example, 15 USDC. Then:
* Alice will get 1.5 USDC due to `15 * 10%`
* Bob will get 0.75 USDC due to `15 * 5%`
* Eve (borrower) will get 12.75 USDC, but these tokens should compensate lenders first.

For example:
* Alice will get 10 USDC due to `15 * (10% / (10% + 5%))`
* Bob will get 5 USDC due to `15 * (5% / (10% + 5%))`
* Eve (borrower) will get 0 USDC

## Impact

The lenders will lose funds, the paid amount should compensate lenders first.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The paid amount should not be sent to the borrower if `loan.payment.paid` doesn't have enough money.

```solidity
    function claimAsBorrower(uint256[] calldata loanIds) external returns (uint256 sent) {
        ...
            if (loan.payment.liquidated) {
                loan.payment.borrowerClaimed = true;
                sentTemp = loan.payment.paid.mul(ONE.sub(loan.shareLent));
+               if (loan.payment.paid < loan.lent) {
+                   sentTemp = 0;
+               }
            } else {
                revert LoanNotRepaidOrLiquidatedYet(loanId);
            }
        ...
    }

    function sendShareOfSaleAsSupplier(
        Loan storage loan,
        Provision storage provision
    ) internal returns (uint256 sent) {
        if (loan.payment.paid < loan.lent) {
            sent = loan.payment.paid.mul(provision.share).div(loan.shareLent);
        } else {
            sent = loan.payment.paid.mul(provision.share);
        }
        loan.assetLent.checkedTransfer(msg.sender, sent);
    }
```
