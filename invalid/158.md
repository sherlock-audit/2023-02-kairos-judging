# Risk of borrower not being able to pay back

# Risk of borrower not being able to pay back

## Summary

The `repay` function of the contract `RepayFacet.sol` uses the function `checkedTransferFrom`, which per se, uses the ERC20 `transferFrom` to transfer the funds from the `msg.sender` back to the Kairos contract `address(this)`. But the `ERC20` `transferFrom` function, requires funds to be previously `approved`, which is not checked.  See details below.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here, the external function `repay` calls the `checkedTransferFrom`. As the library `Erc20CheckedTransfer` is being used for `IERC20` tokens, the function above will be called.
```solidity=
    using Erc20CheckedTransfer for IERC20;
    ...
    /// @dev repay on behalf is activated, the collateral goes to the original borrower
    function repay(uint256[] memory loanIds) external {
    ... 
    loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toRepay);
    ...
    }
```

The function `checkedTransferFrom` from the library `Erc20CheckedTransfer` will call the `ERC20` `transferFrom` function. This `msg.sender` above is passed as a parameter and becomes the `from` in the function below:

```solidity=
    function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, from, to);
        }
    }
```

which requires funds to be previously approved, as we can see on the OZ `ERC20` implementation (now, the `from` parameter is the one who owns the tokens):

```solidity=
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool) {
        address spender = _msgSender();
        _spendAllowance(from, spender, amount);
        _transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

The code snipet above, from OZ `ERC20` implementation, calls the function `_spendAllowance`, which checks if `msg.sender`, the `spender` is approved to spend on behalf of the `from` (which owns the tokens). The `msg.sender` now is the Kairos contract who is trying to spend on behalf of the `from`.

```solidity=
    function _spendAllowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(owner, spender);
        if (currentAllowance != type(uint256).max) {
            require(currentAllowance >= amount, "ERC20: insufficient allowance");
            unchecked {
                _approve(owner, spender, currentAllowance - amount);
            }
        }
    }
```
As we can see above, the `spender` needs to be approved to spend on behalf of the `owner` (the `from` parameter on the previous call).

As it stated by the first comment above (before the `repay` function), and on the Kairos documentation, anyone is allowed to pay a loan to a borrower. Then it is important to check if the payer allowed Kairos contract to spend the `ERC20` tokens on behalf of him.

The `EPI20` specs also states the needing for that chack  

[eip-20#methods](`https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#methods`)

`The function SHOULD throw unless the _from account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.`

The transaction will fail and the user will not be properly informed about the error.


## Impact

Borrower not able to payback loans. Borrower could not be properly informed about the need to approval and his loan could reach liquidation time limit.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider checking for the approval, before calling the `transferFrom`. Add an check for the approval and, if not enough amount, call approve, on the file `Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol`:

[Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol#L9](`https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/utils/Erc20CheckedTransfer.sol#L9`)

```solidity=
    function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
+       if(currency.allowance(from,address(this))<amount){
+           if(!currency.approve(address(this),amount)){
+                revert ERC20TransferNotAllowed(currency, from, to);
+            }
+       }
        if (!currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, from, to);
        }
    }
    ...
    } 
```

[Errors.sol#L10](`https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos/blob/main/kairos-contracts/src/DataStructure/Errors.sol#L10`)

Add an `error` on the `Errors.sol`:
`error ERC20TransferNotAllowed(IERC20 token, address from, address to);`

```solidity=
...
    error ERC20TransferFailed(IERC20 token, address from, address to);
+   error ERC20TransferNotAllowed(IERC20 token, address from, address to);
...
```
