# Unsafe usage of ERC20 transferFrom

## Summary
Unsafe usage of ERC20 transferFrom

## Vulnerability Detail
This function calls the CheckedTransferFrom function of the Erc20CheckedTransfer library contract, passing in 

```solidity
function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount)
```
However, this function is dealing with an IERC20 standard, which typically needs to return a bool value in Order
to be considered a valid transfer.

## Impact
This means that if the transferFrom function on the IERC20 token that you are using 
does not return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not, 
and the transfer fails for any reason (such as insufficient balance or a problem with the token contract), 
then the checkedTransferFrom function will revert, and the useLoan function will also revert. This also means
that any NFTs that were due to be purchased, will not be and any gas spent on the transaction will be lost.

## Tool used
vs code
Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can try to mitigate the above using the below refactored code.

```solidity
function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal returns (bool) {
    if (currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

Its also worth using OZ SafeERC20 library when interacting with ERC20 tokens.

Also in BorrowHandlers, function useOffer line 88.
