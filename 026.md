# Assets with transaction fees will result in losses for protocol.

## Summary
Assets with transaction fees will result in losses for protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `repay` function, if `assetLent` is an ERC20 token with transfer fees, the actual amount received by the protocol will be less than `toRepay`.

https://github.com/kairos-loan/kairos-contracts/blob/main/src/RepayFacet.sol#L57
```solidity
toRepay = lent + interests;
loan.payment.paid = toRepay;
loan.payment.borrowerClaimed = true;
loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toRepay)
```
## Impact
The actual amount received by the protocol will be less than `toRepay`.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/kairos-loan/kairos-contracts/blob/main/src/RepayFacet.sol#L57
```solidity
toRepay = lent + interests;
loan.payment.paid = toRepay;
loan.payment.borrowerClaimed = true;
loan.assetLent.checkedTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), toRepay)
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add ERC20 whitelist or check balance changes before and after transfer.
