# ERC20 tokens with no return value will fail to transfer

## Summary
Even though the ERC20 standard suggests that `transfer` and `transferFrom` has to return `true` on successful transfer, many tokens do not return any value at all. The most known tokens with this issue are [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L126), [BNB](https://etherscan.io/token/0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52#code#L81), and OMG.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say that  `Loan.assetLent` is a token, that doesn't return `bool` on `transfer` or `transferFrom`. In that case, both `checkedTransferFrom` and `checkedTransfer` functions will revert even though the transfer is successful.

## Impact
Users will not be able to use well-known tokens such as USDT and BNB, because the transfer will always fail even though it is successful.
