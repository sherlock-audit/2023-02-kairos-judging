# Tokens that don't return true on successful transfer will always revert

## Summary

Tokens that don't return true on successful transfer will always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `checkedTransfer` and `checkedTransferFrom` implement a revert in case a transfer success status is false.

```solidity
library Erc20CheckedTransfer {
    function checkedTransferFrom(IERC20 currency, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!currency.transferFrom(from, to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, from, to);
        }
    }

    function checkedTransfer(IERC20 currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!currency.transfer(to, amount)) {
            revert ERC20TransferFailed(currency, address(this), to);
        }
    }
}
```

Some tokens don't return a bool value on failure or success and therefore the above functions would be ineffective.
For instance, when transferring borrowed funds from the lender to borrower, the above functions will revert even for a successful transfer.

## Impact

The implementation would break the functioning of the protocol including the ability of borrowers to borrow certain tokens.

## Recommendation

Use openZeppelin's `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` functions in the `Erc20CheckedTransfer` library as they will ensure bool return values.
